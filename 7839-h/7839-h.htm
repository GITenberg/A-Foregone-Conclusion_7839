    <p>
      As Don Ippolito passed down the long narrow <i>calle</i> or footway
      leading from the Campo San Stefano to the Grand Canal in Venice, he peered
      anxiously about him: now turning for a backward look up the calle, where
      there was no living thing in sight but a cat on a garden gate; now running
      a quick eye along the palace walls that rose vast on either hand and
      notched the slender strip of blue sky visible overhead with the lines of
      their jutting balconies, chimneys, and cornices; and now glancing toward
      the canal, where he could see the noiseless black boats meeting and
      passing. There was no sound in the calle save his own footfalls and the
      harsh scream of a parrot that hung in the sunshine in one of the loftiest
      windows; but the note of a peasant crying pots of pinks and roses in the
      campo came softened to Don Ippolito&rsquo;s sense, and he heard the gondoliers
      as they hoarsely jested together and gossiped, with the canal between
      them, at the next gondola station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first tenderness of spring was in the air though down in that calle
      there was yet enough of the wintry rawness to chill the tip of Don
      Ippolito&rsquo;s sensitive nose, which he rubbed for comfort with a handkerchief
      of dark blue calico, and polished for ornament with a handkerchief of
      white linen. He restored each to a different pocket in the sides of the
      ecclesiastical <i>talare</i>, or gown, reaching almost to his ankles, and
      then clutched the pocket in which he had replaced the linen handkerchief,
      as if to make sure that something he prized was safe within. He paused
      abruptly, and, looking at the doors he had passed, went back a few paces
      and stood before one over which hung, slightly tilted forward, an oval
      sign painted with the effigy of an eagle, a bundle of arrows, and certain
      thunderbolts, and bearing the legend, CONSULATE OF THE UNITED STATES, in
      neat characters. Don Ippolito gave a quick sigh, hesitated a moment, and
      then seized the bell-pull and jerked it so sharply that it seemed to
      thrust out, like a part of the mechanism, the head of an old serving-woman
      at the window above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; demanded this head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito in a rich, sad voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you command?&rdquo; further asked the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito paused, apparently searching for his voice, before he
      inquired, &ldquo;Is it here that the Consul of America lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he perhaps at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I will go ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me that pleasure, dear,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, and remained knotting his
      fingers before the closed door. Presently the old woman returned, and
      looking out long enough to say, &ldquo;The consul is at home,&rdquo; drew some inner
      bolt by a wire running to the lock, that let the door start open; then,
      waiting to hear Don Ippolito close it again, she called out from her
      height, &ldquo;Favor me above.&rdquo; He climbed the dim stairway to the point where
      she stood, and followed her to a door, which she flung open into an
      apartment so brightly lit by a window looking on the sunny canal, that he
      blinked as he entered. &ldquo;Signor Console,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;behold the
      gentleman who desired to see you;&rdquo; and at the same time Don Ippolito,
      having removed his broad, stiff, three-cornered hat, came forward and made
      a beautiful bow. He had lost for the moment the trepidation which had
      marked his approach to the consulate, and bore himself with graceful
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the first year of the war, and from a motive of patriotism
      common at that time, Mr. Ferris (one of my many predecessors in office at
      Venice) had just been crossing his two silken gondola flags above the
      consular bookcase, where with their gilt lance-headed staves, and their
      vivid stars and stripes, they made a very pretty effect. He filliped a
      little dust from his coat, and begged Don Ippolito to be seated, with the
      air of putting even a Venetian priest on a footing of equality with other
      men under the folds of the national banner. Mr. Ferris had the prejudice
      of all Italian sympathizers against the priests; but for this he could
      hardly have found anything in Don Ippolito to alarm dislike. His face was
      a little thin, and the chin was delicate; the nose had a fine, Dantesque
      curve, but its final droop gave a melancholy cast to a countenance
      expressive of a gentle and kindly spirit; the eyes were large and dark and
      full of a dreamy warmth. Don Ippolito&rsquo;s prevailing tint was that
      transparent blueishness which comes from much shaving of a heavy black
      beard; his forehead and temples were marble white; he had a tonsure the
      size of a dollar. He sat silent for a little space, and softly questioned
      the consul&rsquo;s face with his dreamy eyes. Apparently he could not gather
      courage to speak of his business at once, for he turned his gaze upon the
      window and said, &ldquo;A beautiful position, Signor Console.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a pretty place,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ferris, warily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much pleasanter here on the Canalazzo than on the campos or the little
      canals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, without doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here there must be constant amusement in watching the boats: great stir,
      great variety, great life. And now the fine season commences, and the
      Signor Console&rsquo;s countrymen will be coming to Venice. Perhaps,&rdquo; added Don
      Ippolito with a polite dismay, and an air of sudden anxiety to escape from
      his own purpose, &ldquo;I may be disturbing or detaining the Signor Console?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris; &ldquo;I am quite at leisure for the present. In what can
      I have the honor of serving you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito heaved a long, ineffectual sigh, and taking his linen
      handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his forehead with it, and rolled it
      upon his knee. He looked at the door, and all round the room, and then
      rose and drew near the consul, who had officially seated himself at his
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that the Signor Console gives passports?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ferris, with a clouding face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito seemed to note the gathering distrust and to be helpless
      against it. He continued hastily: &ldquo;Could the Signor Console give a
      passport for America ... to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an American citizen?&rdquo; demanded the consul in the voice of a man
      whose suspicions are fully roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;American citizen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; subject of the American republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, surely; I have not that happiness. I am an Austrian subject,&rdquo;
       returned Don Ippolito a little bitterly, as if the last words were an
      unpleasant morsel in the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t give you a passport,&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris, somewhat more gently.
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that no government can give passports to
      foreign subjects. That would be an unheard-of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought that to go to America an American passport would be
      needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In America,&rdquo; returned the consul, with proud compassion, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t care
      a fig for passports. You go and you come, and nobody meddles. To be sure,&rdquo;
       he faltered, &ldquo;just now, on account of the secessionists, they <i>do</i>
      require you to show a passport at New York; but,&rdquo; he continued more
      boldly, &ldquo;American passports are usually for Europe; and besides, all the
      American passports in the world wouldn&rsquo;t get <i>you</i> over the frontier
      at Peschiera. <i>You</i> must have a passport from the Austrian
      Lieutenancy of Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito nodded his head softly several times, and said, &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo;
       and then added with an indescribable weariness, &ldquo;Patience! Signor Console,
      I ask your pardon for the trouble I have given,&rdquo; and he made the consul
      another low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s curiosity was piqued, and feeling himself on the safe
      side of his visitor he meant to know why he had come on such an errand, or
      whether he had some kindlier motive, he could hardly have told himself,
      but he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. Perhaps there is something else in which I
      could be of use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I hardly know,&rdquo; cried Don Ippolito. &ldquo;I really had a kind of hope in
      coming to your excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not an excellency,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Ferris, conscientiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many excuses! But now it seems a mere bestiality. I was so ignorant about
      the other matter that doubtless I am also quite deluded in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that, of course I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ferris, &ldquo;but I hope
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, listen, signore!&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, placing his hand over that
      pocket in which he kept his linen handkerchief. &ldquo;I had something that it
      had come into my head to offer your honored government for its advantage
      in this deplorable rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; responded Mr. Ferris with a falling countenance. He had received so
      many offers of help for his honored government from sympathizing
      foreigners. Hardly a week passed but a sabre came clanking up his dim
      staircase with a Herr Graf or a Herr Baron attached, who appeared in the
      spotless panoply of his Austrian captaincy or lieutenancy, to accept from
      the consul a brigadier-generalship in the Federal armies, on condition
      that the consul would pay his expenses to Washington, or at least assure
      him of an exalted post and reimbursement of all outlays from President
      Lincoln as soon as he arrived. They were beautiful men, with the
      complexion of blonde girls; their uniforms fitted like kid gloves; the
      pale blue, or pure white, or huzzar black of their coats was ravishingly
      set off by their red or gold trimmings; and they were hard to make
      understand that brigadiers of American birth swarmed at Washington, and
      that if they went thither, they must go as soldiers of fortune at their
      own risk. But they were very polite; they begged pardon when they knocked
      their scabbards against the consul&rsquo;s furniture, at the door they each made
      him a magnificent obeisance, said &ldquo;Servus!&rdquo; in their great voices, and
      were shown out by the old Marina, abhorrent of their uniforms and doubtful
      of the consul&rsquo;s political sympathies. Only yesterday she had called him up
      at an unwonted hour to receive the visit of a courtly gentleman who
      addressed him as Monsieur le Ministre, and offered him at a bargain ten
      thousand stand of probably obsolescent muskets belonging to the late Duke
      of Parma. Shabby, hungry, incapable exiles of all nations, religions, and
      politics beset him for places of honor and emolument in the service of the
      Union; revolutionists out of business, and the minions of banished
      despots, were alike willing to be fed, clothed, and dispatched to
      Washington with swords consecrated to the perpetuity of the republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, too intent upon showing whatever it was
      he had to note the change in the consul&rsquo;s mood, &ldquo;the model of a weapon of
      my contrivance, which I thought the government of the North could employ
      successfully in cases where its batteries were in danger of capture by the
      Spaniards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spaniards? Spaniards? We have no war with Spain!&rdquo; cried the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; Don Ippolito made haste to explain, &ldquo;but those of
      South America being Spanish by descent&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are not fighting the South Americans. We are fighting our own
      Southern States, I am sorry to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Many excuses. I am afraid I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito
      meekly; whereupon Mr. Ferris enlightened him in a formula (of which he was
      beginning to be weary) against European misconception of the American
      situation. Don Ippolito nodded his head contritely, and when Mr. Ferris
      had ended, he was so much abashed that he made no motion to show his
      invention till the other added, &ldquo;But no matter; I suppose the contrivance
      would work as well against the Southerners as the South Americans. Let me
      see it, please;&rdquo; and then Don Ippolito, with a gratified smile, drew from
      his pocket the neatly finished model of a breech-loading cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You perceive, Signor Console,&rdquo; he said with new dignity, &ldquo;that this is
      nothing very new as a breech-loader, though I ask you to observe this
      little improvement for restoring the breech to its place, which is
      original. The grand feature of my invention, however, is this secret
      chamber in the breech, which is intended to hold an explosive of high
      potency, with a fuse coming out below. The gunner, finding his piece in
      danger, ignites this fuse, and takes refuge in flight. At the moment the
      enemy seizes the gun the contents of the secret chamber explode,
      demolishing the piece and destroying its captors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dreamy warmth in Don Ippolito&rsquo;s deep eyes kindled to a flame; a dark
      red glowed in his thin cheeks; he drew a box from the folds of his drapery
      and took snuff in a great whiff, as if inhaling the sulphurous fumes of
      battle, or titillating his nostrils with grains of gunpowder. He was at
      least in full enjoyment of the poetic power of his invention, and no doubt
      had before his eyes a vivid picture of a score of secessionists surprised
      and blown to atoms in the very moment of triumph. &ldquo;Behold, Signor
      Console!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly very curious,&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris, turning the fearful toy
      over in his hand, and admiring the neat workmanship of it. &ldquo;Did you make
      this model yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered the priest, with a joyous pride; &ldquo;I have no money to
      spend upon artisans; and besides, as you might infer, signore, I am not
      very well seen by my superiors and associates on account of these little
      amusements of mine; so keep them as much as I can to myself.&rdquo; Don Ippolito
      laughed nervously, and then fell silent with his eyes intent upon the
      consul&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What do you think, signore?&rdquo; he presently resumed. &ldquo;If
      this invention were brought to the notice of your generous government,
      would it not patronize my labors? I have read that America is the land of
      enterprises. Who knows but your government might invite me to take service
      under it in some capacity in which I could employ those little gifts that
      Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;He paused again, apparently puzzled by the compassionate
      smile on the consul&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;But tell me, signore, how this invention
      appears to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you had any practical experience in gunnery?&rdquo; asked
      Mr. Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; continued Mr. Ferris, &ldquo;but I was wondering whether the
      explosive in this secret chamber would not become so heated by the
      frequent discharges of the piece as to go off prematurely sometimes, and
      kill our own artillerymen instead of waiting for the secessionists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito&rsquo;s countenance fell, and a dull shame displaced the exultation
      that had glowed in it. His head sunk on his breast, and he made no attempt
      at reply, so that it was again Mr. Ferris who spoke. &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t
      really know anything more of the matter than you do, and I don&rsquo;t undertake
      to say whether your invention is disabled by the possibility I suggest or
      not. Haven&rsquo;t you any acquaintances among the military, to whom you could
      show your model?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito, coldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consort with the military.
      Besides, what would be thought of a <i>priest</i>,&rdquo; he asked with a bitter
      stress on the word, &ldquo;who exhibited such an invention as that to an officer
      of our paternal government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it would certainly surprise the lieutenant-governor somewhat,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Ferris with a laugh. &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he pursued after an interval,
      &ldquo;whether you have occupied yourself with other inventions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have attempted a great many,&rdquo; replied Don Ippolito in a tone of
      dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all of this warlike temper?&rdquo; pursued the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, blushing a little, &ldquo;they are nearly all of
      peaceful intention. It was the wish to produce something of utility which
      set me about this cannon. Those good friends of mine who have done me the
      honor of looking at my attempts had blamed me for the uselessness of my
      inventions; they allowed that they were ingenious, but they said that even
      if they could be put in operation, they would not be what the world cared
      for. Perhaps they were right. I know very little of the world,&rdquo; concluded
      the priest, sadly. He had risen to go, yet seemed not quite able to do so;
      there was no more to say, but if he had come to the consul with high
      hopes, it might well have unnerved him to have all end so blankly. He drew
      a long, sibilant breath between his shut teeth, nodded to himself thrice,
      and turning to Mr. Ferris with a melancholy bow, said, &ldquo;Signor Console, I
      thank you infinitely for your kindness, I beg your pardon for the
      disturbance, and I take my leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris. &ldquo;Let us see each other again. In regard to
      the inventions,&mdash;well, you must have patience.&rdquo; He dropped into some
      proverbial phrases which the obliging Latin tongues supply so abundantly
      for the races who must often talk when they do not feel like thinking, and
      he gave a start when Don Ippolito replied in English, &ldquo;Yes, but hope
      deferred maketh the heart sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not that it was so uncommon to have Italians innocently come out
      with their whole slender stock of English to him, for the sake of
      practice, as they told him; but there were peculiarities in Don Ippolito&rsquo;s
      accent for which he could not account. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you know
      English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have studied it a little, by myself,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito, pleased
      to have his English recognized, and then lapsing into the safety of
      Italian, he added, &ldquo;And I had also the help of an English ecclesiastic who
      sojourned some months in Venice, last year, for his health, and who used
      to read with me and teach me the pronunciation. He was from Dublin, this
      ecclesiastic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris, with relief, &ldquo;I see;&rdquo; and he perceived that what
      had puzzled him in Don Ippolito&rsquo;s English was a fine brogue superimposed
      upon his Italian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some time I have had this idea of going to America, and I thought
      that the first thing to do was to equip myself with the language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Mr. Ferris, &ldquo;that was practical, at any rate,&rdquo; and he mused
      awhile. By and by he continued, more kindly than he had yet spoken, &ldquo;I
      wish I could ask you to sit down again: but I have an engagement which I
      must make haste to keep. Are you going out through the campo? Pray wait a
      minute, and I will walk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferris went into another room, through the open door of which Don
      Ippolito saw the paraphernalia of a painter&rsquo;s studio: an easel with a
      half-finished picture on it; a chair with a palette and brushes, and
      crushed and twisted tubes of colors; a lay figure in one corner; on the
      walls scraps of stamped leather, rags of tapestry, desultory sketches on
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferris came out again, brushing his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signor Console amuses himself with painting, I see,&rdquo; said Don
      Ippolito courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ferris, putting on his gloves; &ldquo;I am a painter
      by profession, and I amuse myself with consuling;&rdquo; [Footnote: Since these
      words of Mr. Ferris were first printed, I have been told that a more
      eminent painter, namely Rubens, made very much the same reply to very much
      the same remark, when Spanish Ambassador in England. &ldquo;The Ambassador of
      His Catholic Majesty, I see, amuses himself by painting sometimes,&rdquo; said a
      visitor who found him at his easel. &ldquo;I amuse myself by playing the
      ambassador sometimes,&rdquo; answered Rubens. In spite of the similarity of the
      speeches, I let that of Mr. Ferris stand, for I am satisfied that he did
      not know how unhandsomely Rubens had taken the words out of his mouth.]
      and as so open a matter needed no explanation, he said no more about it.
      Nor is it quite necessary to tell how, as he was one day painting in New
      York, it occurred to him to make use of a Congressional friend, and ask
      for some Italian consulate, he did not care which. That of Venice happened
      to be vacant: the income was a few hundred dollars; as no one else wanted
      it, no question was made of Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s fitness for the post, and he
      presently found himself possessed of a commission requesting the Emperor
      of Austria to permit him to enjoy and exercise the office of consul of the
      ports of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, to which the President of the
      United States appointed him from a special trust in his abilities and
      integrity. He proceeded at once to his post of duty, called upon the
      ship&rsquo;s chandler with whom they had been left, for the consular archives,
      and began to paint some Venetian subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Don Ippolito quitted the Consulate together, leaving Marina to
      digest with her noonday porridge the wonder that he should be walking
      amicably forth with a priest. The same spectacle was presented to the gaze
      of the campo, where they paused in friendly converse, and were seen to
      part with many politenesses by the doctors of the neighborhood, lounging
      away their leisure, as the Venetian fashion is, at the local pharmacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apothecary craned forward over his counter, and peered through the
      open door. &ldquo;What is that blessed Consul of America doing with a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Consul of America with a priest?&rdquo; demanded a grave old man, a
      physician with a beautiful silvery beard, and a most reverend and
      senatorial presence, but one of the worst tongues in Venice. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he
      added, with a laugh, after scrutiny of the two through his glasses, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      that crack-brain Don Ippolito Rondinelli. He isn&rsquo;t priest enough to hurt
      the consul. Perhaps he&rsquo;s been selling him a perpetual motion for the use
      of his government, which needs something of the kind just now. Or maybe
      he&rsquo;s been posing to him for a picture. He would make a very pretty Joseph,
      give him Potiphar&rsquo;s wife in the background,&rdquo; said the doctor, who if not
      maligned would have needed much more to make a Joseph of him.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferris took his way through the devious footways where the shadow was
      chill, and through the broad campos where the sun was tenderly warm, and
      the towers of the church rose against the speck-less azure of the vernal
      heaven. As he went along, he frowned in a helpless perplexity with the
      case of Don Ippolito, whom he had begun by doubting for a spy with some
      incomprehensible motive, and had ended by pitying with a certain degree of
      amusement and a deep sense of the futility of his compassion. He presently
      began to think of him with a little disgust, as people commonly think of
      one whom they pity and yet cannot help, and he made haste to cast off the
      hopeless burden. He shrugged his shoulders, struck his stick on the smooth
      paving-stones, and let his eyes rove up and down the fronts of the houses,
      for the sake of the pretty faces that glanced out of the casements. He was
      a young man, and it was spring, and this was Venice. He made himself
      joyfully part of the city and the season; he was glad of the narrowness of
      the streets, of the good-humored jostling and pushing; he crouched into an
      arched doorway to let a water-carrier pass with her copper buckets
      dripping at the end of the yoke balanced on her shoulder, and he returned
      her smiles and excuses with others as broad and gay; he brushed by the
      swelling hoops of ladies, and stooped before the unwieldy burdens of
      porters, who as they staggered through the crowd with a thrust hero, and a
      shove there forgave themselves, laughing, with &ldquo;We are in Venice,
      signori;&rdquo; and he stood aside for the files of soldiers clanking heavily
      over the pavement, then muskets kindling to a blaze in the sunlit campos
      and quenched again in the damp shadows of the calles. His ear was taken by
      the vibrant jargoning of the boatmen as they pushed their craft under the
      bridges he crossed, and the keen notes of the canaries and the songs of
      the golden-billed blackbirds whose cages hung at lattices far overhead.
      Heaps of oranges, topped by the fairest cut in halves, gave their color,
      at frequent intervals, to the dusky corners and recesses and the
      long-drawn cry of the venders, &ldquo;Oranges of Palermo!&rdquo; rose above the
      clatter of feet and the clamor of other voices. At a little shop where
      butter and eggs and milk abounded, together with early flowers of various
      sorts, he bought a bunch of hyacinths, blue and white and yellow, and he
      presently stood smelling these while he waited in the hotel parlor for the
      ladies to whom he had sent his card. He turned at the sound of drifting
      drapery, and could not forbear placing the hyacinths in the hand of Miss
      Florida Vervain, who had come into the room to receive him. She was a girl
      of about seventeen years, who looked older; she was tall rather than
      short, and rather full,&mdash;though it could not be said that she erred
      in point of solidity. In the attitudes of shy hauteur into which she
      constantly fell, there was a touch of defiant awkwardness which had a
      certain fascination. She was blonde, with a throat and hands of milky
      whiteness; there was a suggestion of freckles on her regular face, where a
      quick color came and went, though her cheeks were habitually somewhat
      pale; her eyes were very blue under their level brows, and the lashes were
      even lighter in color than the masses of her fair gold hair; the edges of
      the lids were touched with the faintest red. The late Colonel Vervain of
      the United States army, whose complexion his daughter had inherited, was
      an officer whom it would not have been peaceable to cross in any purpose
      or pleasure, and Miss Vervain seemed sometimes a little burdened by the
      passionate nature which he had left her together with the tropical name he
      had bestowed in honor of the State where he had fought the Seminoles in
      his youth, and where he chanced still to be stationed when she was born;
      she had the air of being embarrassed in presence of herself, and of having
      an anxious watch upon her impulses. I do not know how otherwise to
      describe the effort of proud, helpless femininity, which would have struck
      the close observer in Miss Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; she said, in a deep voice, which conveyed something of this
      anxiety in its guarded tones, and yet was not wanting in a kind of
      frankness. &ldquo;Did you mean them for me, Mr. Ferris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, but I do,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ferris. &ldquo;I bought them in ignorance,
      but I understand now what they were meant for by nature;&rdquo; and in fact the
      hyacinths, with their smooth textures and their pure colors, harmonized
      well with Miss Vervain, as she bent her face over them and inhaled their
      full, rich perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will put them in water,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment.
      Mother will be down directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could return, her mother rustled into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain was gracefully, fragilely unlike her daughter. She entered
      with a gentle and gliding step, peering near-sightedly about through her
      glasses, and laughing triumphantly when she had determined Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s
      exact position, where he stood with a smile shaping his full brown beard
      and glancing from his hazel eyes. She was dressed in perfect taste with
      reference to her matronly years, and the lingering evidences of her
      widowhood, and she had an unaffected naturalness of manner which even at
      her age of forty-eight could not be called less than charming. She spoke
      in a trusting, caressing tone, to which no man at least could respond
      unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So very good of you, to take all this trouble, Mr. Ferris,&rdquo; she said,
      giving him a friendly hand, &ldquo;and I suppose you are letting us encroach
      upon very valuable time. I&rsquo;m quite ashamed to take it. But isn&rsquo;t it a
      heavenly day? What <i>I</i> call a perfect day, just right every way; none
      of those disagreeable extremes. It&rsquo;s so unpleasant to have it too hot, for
      instance. I&rsquo;m the greatest person for moderation, Mr. Ferris, and I carry
      the principle into everything; but I do think the breakfasts at these
      Italian hotels are too light altogether. I like our American breakfasts,
      don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve been telling Florida I can&rsquo;t stand it; we really must make
      some arrangement. To be sure, you oughtn&rsquo;t to think of such a thing as
      eating, in a place like Venice, all poetry; but a sound mind in a sound
      body, <i>I</i> say. We&rsquo;re perfectly wild over it. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a
      place that grows upon you very much, Mr. Ferris? All those associations,&mdash;it
      does seem too much; and the gondolas everywhere. But I&rsquo;m always afraid the
      gondoliers cheat us; and in the stores I never feel safe a moment&mdash;not
      a moment. I do think the Venetians are lacking in truthfulness, a little.
      I don&rsquo;t believe they understand our American fairdealing and sincerity. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t want to do them injustice, but I really think they take
      advantages in bargaining. Now such a thing even as corals. Florida is
      extremely fond of them, and we bought a set yesterday in the Piazza, and I
      <i>know</i> we paid too much for them. Florida,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, for
      her daughter had reentered the room, and stood with some shawls and wraps
      upon her arm, patiently waiting for the conclusion of the elder lady&rsquo;s
      speech, &ldquo;I wish you would bring down that set of corals. I&rsquo;d like Mr.
      Ferris to give an unbiased opinion. I&rsquo;m sure we were cheated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about corals, Mrs. Vervain,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but you ought to see this set for the beauty of the color; they&rsquo;re
      really exquisite. I&rsquo;m sure it will gratify your artistic taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vervain hesitated with a look of desire to obey, and of doubt whether
      to force the pleasure upon Mr. Ferris. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it do another time, mother?&rdquo;
       she asked faintly; &ldquo;the gondola is waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain gave a frailish start from the chair, into which she had
      sunk, &ldquo;Oh, do let us be off at once, then,&rdquo; she said; and when they stood
      on the landing-stairs of the hotel: &ldquo;What gloomy things these gondolas
      are!&rdquo; she added, while the gondolier with one foot on the gunwale of the
      boat received the ladies&rsquo; shawls, and then crooked his arm for them to
      rest a hand on in stepping aboard; &ldquo;I wonder they don&rsquo;t paint them some
      cheerful color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue, or pink, Mrs. Vervain?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ferris. &ldquo;I knew you were coming
      to that question; they all do. But we needn&rsquo;t have the top on at all, if
      it depresses your spirits. We shall be just warm enough in the open
      sunlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have it off, then. It sends the cold chills over me to look at it.
      What <i>did</i> Byron call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s time for Byron, now. It was very good of you not to mention
      him before, Mrs. Vervain. But I knew he had to come. He called it a coffin
      clapped in a canoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;I always feel as if I were going to my own
      funeral when I get into it; and I&rsquo;ve certainly had enough of funerals
      never to want to have anything to do with another, as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She settled herself luxuriously upon the feather-stuffed leathern cushions
      when the cabin was removed. Death had indeed been near her very often;
      father and mother had been early lost to her, and the brothers and sisters
      orphaned with her had faded and perished one after another, as they
      ripened to men and women; she had seen four of her own children die; her
      husband had been dead six years. All these bereavements had left her what
      they had found her. She had truly grieved, and, as she said, she had
      hardly ever been out of black since she could remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was in colors when I was a girl,&rdquo; she went on, indulging many
      obituary memories as the gondola dipped and darted down the canal, &ldquo;and I
      was married in my mourning for my last sister. It did seem a little too
      much when she went, Mr. Ferris. I was too young to feel it so much about
      the others, but we were nearly of the same age, and that makes a
      difference, don&rsquo;t you know. First a brother and then a sister: it was very
      strange how they kept going that way. I seemed to break the charm when I
      got married; though, to be sure, there was no brother left after Marian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Vervain heard her mother&rsquo;s mortuary prattle with a face from which no
      impatience of it could be inferred, and Mr. Ferris made no comment on what
      was oddly various in character and manner, for Mrs. Vervain touched upon
      the gloomiest facts of her history with a certain impersonal statistical
      interest. They were rowing across the lagoon to the Island of San Lazzaro,
      where for reasons of her own she intended to venerate the convent in which
      Byron studied the Armenian language preparatory to writing his great poem
      in it; if her pilgrimage had no very earnest motive, it was worthy of the
      fact which it was designed to honor. The lagoon was of a perfect, shining
      smoothness, broken by the shallows over which the ebbing tide had left the
      sea-weed trailed like long, disheveled hair. The fishermen, as they waded
      about staking their nets, or stooped to gather the small shell-fish of the
      shallows, showed legs as brown and tough as those of the apostles in
      Titian&rsquo;s Assumption. Here and there was a boat, with a boy or an old man
      asleep in the bottom of it. The gulls sailed high, white flakes against
      the illimitable blue of the heavens; the air, though it was of early
      spring, and in the shade had a salty pungency, was here almost
      languorously warm; in the motionless splendors and rich colors of the
      scene there was a melancholy before which Mrs. Vervain fell fitfully
      silent. Now and then Ferris briefly spoke, calling Miss Vervain&rsquo;s notice
      to this or that, and she briefly responded. As they passed the mad-house
      of San Servolo, a maniac standing at an open window took his black velvet
      skull-cap from his white hair, bowed low three times, and kissed his hand
      to the ladies. The Lido in front of them stretched a brown strip of sand
      with white villages shining out of it; on their left the Public Gardens
      showed a mass of hovering green; far beyond and above, the ghostlike snows
      of the Alpine heights haunted the misty horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was chill in the shadow of the convent when they landed at San Lazzaro,
      and it was cool in the parlor where they waited for the monk who was to
      show them through the place; but it was still and warm in the gardened
      court, where the bees murmured among the crocuses and hyacinths under the
      noonday sun. Miss Vervain stood looking out of the window upon the lagoon,
      while her mother drifted about the room, peering at the objects on the
      wall through her eyeglasses. She was praising a Chinese painting of fish
      on rice-paper, when a young monk entered with a cordial greeting in
      English for Mr. Ferris. She turned and saw them shaking hands, but at the
      same moment her eyeglasses abandoned her nose with a vigorous leap; she
      gave an amiable laugh, and groping for them over her dress, bowed at
      random as Mr. Ferris presented Padre Girolamo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been admiring this painting so much, Padre Girolamo,&rdquo; she said, with
      instant good-will, and taking the monk into the easy familiarity of her
      friendship by the tone with which she spoke his name. &ldquo;Some of the
      brothers did it, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said the monk, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a Chinese painting. We hung it up there
      because it was given to us, and was curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, do you know,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;I <i>thought</i> it was
      Chinese! Their things <i>are</i>, so odd. But really, in an Armenian
      convent it&rsquo;s very misleading. I don&rsquo;t think you ought to leave it there;
      it certainly does throw people off the track,&rdquo; she added, subduing the
      expression to something very lady-like, by the winning appeal with which
      she used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but if they put up Armenian paintings in Chinese convents?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain, looking at him with a graciously
      amused air. &ldquo;There <i>are</i> no Chinese convents. To be sure those rebels
      are a kind of Christians,&rdquo; she added thoughtfully, &ldquo;but there can&rsquo;t be
      many of them left, poor things, hundreds of them executed at a time, that
      way. It&rsquo;s perfectly sickening to read of it; and you can&rsquo;t help it, you
      know. But they say they haven&rsquo;t really so much feeling as we have&mdash;not
      so nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked by the side of the young friar as he led the way to such parts
      of the convent as are open to visitors, and Mr. Ferris came after with her
      daughter, who, he fancied, met his attempts at talk with sudden and more
      than usual hauteur. &ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Is she afraid I
      shall be wanting to make love to her?&rdquo; and he followed in rather a sulky
      silence the course of Mrs. Vervain and her guide. The library, the chapel,
      and the museum called out her friendliest praises, and in the last she
      praised the mummy on show there at the expense of one she had seen in New
      York; but when Padre Girolamo pointed out the desk in the refectory from
      which one of the brothers read while the rest were eating, she took him to
      task. &ldquo;Oh, but I can&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s at all good for the digestion, you
      know,&mdash;using the brain that way whilst you&rsquo;re at table. I really hope
      you don&rsquo;t listen too attentively; it would be better for you in the long
      run, even in a religious point of view. But now&mdash;Byron! You <i>must</i>
      show me his cell!&rdquo; The monk deprecated the non-existence of such a cell,
      and glanced in perplexity at Mr. Ferris, who came to his relief. &ldquo;You
      couldn&rsquo;t have seen his cell, if he&rsquo;d had one, Mrs. Vervain. They don&rsquo;t
      admit ladies to the cloister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Vervain, apparently regarding this as
      another of Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s pleasantries; but Padre Girolamo silently
      confirmed his statement, and she briskly assailed the rule as a disrespect
      to the sex, which reflected even upon the Virgin, the object, as he was
      forced to allow, of their high veneration. He smiled patiently, and
      confessed that Mrs. Vervain had all the reasons on her side. At the
      polyglot printing-office, where she handsomely bought every kind of
      Armenian book and pamphlet, and thus repaid in the only way possible the
      trouble their visit had given, he did not offer to take leave of them, but
      after speaking with Ferris, of whom he seemed an old friend, he led them
      through the garden environing the convent, to a little pavilion perched on
      the wall that defends the island from the tides of the lagoon. A
      lay-brother presently followed them, bearing a tray with coffee, toasted
      rusk, and a jar of that conserve of rose-leaves which is the convent&rsquo;s
      delicate hospitality to favored guests. Mrs. Vervain cried out over the
      poetic confection when Padre Girolamo told her what it was, and her
      daughter suffered herself to express a guarded pleasure. The amiable
      matron brushed the crumbs of the <i>baicolo</i> from her lap when the
      lunch was ended, and fitting on her glasses leaned forward for a better
      look at the monk&rsquo;s black-bearded face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly delighted,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;You must be very happy here. I suppose you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the monk rapturously; &ldquo;so happy that I should be content
      never to leave San Lazzaro. I came here when I was very young, and the
      greater part of my life has been passed on this little island. It is my
      home&mdash;my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; sometimes to Constantinople, sometimes to London and Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never been to America yet? Well now, I&rsquo;ll tell you; you ought
      to go. You would like it, I know, and our people would give you a very
      cordial reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reception?&rdquo; The monk appealed once more to Ferris with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris broke into a laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Padre Girolamo would come in
      quality of distinguished foreigner, Mrs. Vervain, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
      know what to do with one of our cordial receptions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he ought to go to America, any way. He can&rsquo;t really know anything
      about us till he&rsquo;s been there. Just think how ignorant the English are of
      our country! You <i>will</i> come, won&rsquo;t you? I should be delighted to
      welcome you at my house in Providence. Rhode Island is a small State, but
      there&rsquo;s a great deal of wealth there, and very good society in Providence.
      It&rsquo;s quite New-Yorky, you know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain expressively. She rose
      as she spoke, and led the way back to the gondola. She told Padre Girolamo
      that they were to be some weeks in Venice, and made him promise to
      breakfast with them at their hotel. She smiled and nodded to him after the
      boat had pushed off, and kept him bowing on the landing-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely place, and what a perfectly heavenly morning you <i>have</i>
      given us, Mr. Ferris I We never can thank you enough for it. And now, do
      you know what I&rsquo;m thinking of? Perhaps you can help me. It was Byron&rsquo;s
      studying there put me in mind of it. How soon do the mosquitoes come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the end of June,&rdquo; responded Ferris mechanically, staring with
      helpless mystification at Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then there&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t stay in Venice till
      that time. We are both very fond of the place, and we&rsquo;d quite concluded,
      this morning, to stop here till the mosquitoes came. You know, Mr. Ferris,
      my daughter had to leave school much earlier than she ought, for my health
      has obliged me to travel a great deal since I lost my husband; and I must
      have her with me, for we&rsquo;re all that there is of us; we haven&rsquo;t a chick or
      a child that&rsquo;s related to us anywhere. But wherever we stop, even for a
      few weeks, I contrive to get her some kind of instruction. I feel the need
      of it so much in my own case; for to tell you the truth, Mr. Ferris, I
      married too young. I suppose I should do the same thing over again if it
      was to be done over; but don&rsquo;t you see, my mind wasn&rsquo;t properly formed;
      and then following my husband about from pillar to post, and my first baby
      born when I was nineteen&mdash;well, it wasn&rsquo;t education, at any rate,
      whatever else it was; and I&rsquo;ve determined that Florida, though we are such
      a pair of wanderers, shall not have my regrets. I got teachers for her in
      England,&mdash;the English are not anything like so disagreeable at home
      as they are in traveling, and we stayed there two years,&mdash;and I did
      in France, and I did in Germany. And now, Italian. Here we are in Italy,
      and I think we ought to improve the time. Florida knows a good deal of
      Italian already, for her music teacher in France was an Italian, and he
      taught her the language as well as music. What she wants now, I should
      say, is to perfect her accent and get facility. I think she ought to have
      some one come every day and read and converse an hour or two with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain leaned back in her seat, and looked at Ferris, who said,
      feeling that the matter was referred to him, &ldquo;I think&mdash;without
      presuming to say what Miss Vervain&rsquo;s need of instruction is&mdash;that
      your idea is a very good one.&rdquo; He mused in silence his wonder that so much
      addlepatedness as was at once observable in Mrs. Vervain should exist
      along with so much common-sense. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly very good in the
      abstract,&rdquo; he added, with a glance at the daughter, as if the sense must
      be hers. She did not meet his glance at once, but with an impatient
      recognition of the heat that was now great for the warmth with which she
      was dressed, she pushed her sleeve from her wrist, showing its delicious
      whiteness, and letting her fingers trail through the cool water; she dried
      them on her handkerchief, and then bent her eyes full upon him as if
      challenging him to think this unlady-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, clearly the sense does not come from her,&rdquo; said Ferris to himself; it
      is impossible to think well of the mind of a girl who treats one with
      tacit contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s certainly very good in the abstract.
      But oh dear me! you&rsquo;ve no idea of the difficulties in the way. I may speak
      frankly with you, Mr. Ferris, for you are here as the representative of
      the country, and you naturally sympathize with the difficulties of
      Americans abroad; the teachers will fall in love with their pupils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; began Miss Vervain; and then she checked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris gave a vengeful laugh. &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Vervain, though I sympathize
      with you in my official capacity, I must own that as a man and a brother,
      I can&rsquo;t help feeling a little sorry for those poor fellows, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, they are to be pitied, of course, and <i>I</i> feel for them;
      I did when I was a girl; for the same thing used to happen then. I don&rsquo;t
      know why Florida should be subjected to such embarrassments, too. It does
      seem sometimes as if it were something in the blood. They all get the idea
      that you have money, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should say that it might be something in the pocket,&rdquo; suggested
      Ferris with a look at Miss Vervain, in whose silent suffering, as he
      imagined it, he found a malicious consolation for her scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever it is,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too vexatious. Of
      course, going to new places, that way, as we&rsquo;re always doing, and only
      going to stay for a limited time, perhaps, you can&rsquo;t pick and choose. And
      even when you <i>do</i> get an elderly teacher, they&rsquo;re as bad as any. It
      really is too trying. Now, when I was talking with that nice monk of yours
      at the convent, there, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how perfectly delightful
      it would be if Florida could have <i>him</i> for a teacher. Why couldn&rsquo;t
      she? He told me that he would come to take breakfast or lunch with us, but
      not dinner, for he always had to be at the convent before nightfall. Well,
      he might come to give the lessons sometime in the middle of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t manage it, Mrs. Vervain, I know you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered
      Ferris earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Armenians never do anything of the kind.
      They&rsquo;re all very busy men, engaged in ecclesiastical or literary work, and
      they couldn&rsquo;t give the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? There was Byron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Byron went to them, and he studied Armenian, not Italian, with them.
      Padre Girolamo speaks perfect Italian, for all that I can see; but I doubt
      if he&rsquo;d undertake to impart the native accent, which is what you want. In
      fact, the scheme is altogether impracticable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m exceedingly sorry. I had quite set my
      heart on it. I never took such a fancy to any one in such a short time
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to be a case of love at first sight on both sides,&rdquo; said
      Ferris. &ldquo;Padre Girolamo doesn&rsquo;t shower those syruped rose-leaves
      indiscriminately upon visitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Vervain; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very good of you to say so, Mr.
      Ferris, and it&rsquo;s very gratifying, all round; but don&rsquo;t you see, it doesn&rsquo;t
      serve the present purpose. What teachers do you know of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been by marriage so long in the service of the United States that
      she still regarded its agents as part of her own domestic economy. Consuls
      she everywhere employed as functionaries specially appointed to look after
      the interests of American ladies traveling without protection. In the week
      which had passed since her arrival in Venice, there had been no day on
      which she did not appeal to Ferris for help or sympathy or advice. She
      took amiable possession of him at once, and she had established an amusing
      sort of intimacy with him, to which the haughty trepidations of her
      daughter set certain bounds, but in which the demand that he should find
      her a suitable Italian teacher seemed trivially matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know several teachers,&rdquo; he said, after thinking awhile; &ldquo;but
      they&rsquo;re all open to the objection of being human; and besides, they all do
      things in a set kind of way, and I&rsquo;m afraid they wouldn&rsquo;t enter into the
      spirit of any scheme of instruction that departed very widely from
      Ollendorff.&rdquo; He paused, and Mrs. Vervain gave a sketch of the different
      professional masters whom she had employed in the various countries of her
      sojourn, and a disquisition upon their several lives and characters,
      fortifying her statements by reference of doubtful points to her daughter.
      This occupied some time, and Ferris listened to it all with an abstracted
      air. At last he said, with a smile, &ldquo;There was an Italian priest came to
      see me this morning, who astonished me by knowing English&mdash;with a
      brogue that he&rsquo;d learned from an English priest straight from Dublin;
      perhaps <i>he</i> might do, Mrs. Vervain? He&rsquo;s professionally pledged, you
      know, not to give the kind of annoyance you&rsquo;ve suffered from in teachers.
      He would do as well as Padre Girolamo, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really? Are you in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I believe I&rsquo;m not. I haven&rsquo;t the least idea he would do. He
      belongs to the church militant. He came to me with the model of a
      breech-loading cannon he&rsquo;s invented, and he wanted a passport to go to
      America, so that he might offer his cannon to our government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curious!&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, and her daughter looked frankly into
      Ferris&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But I know; it&rsquo;s one of your jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overpraise me, Mrs. Vervain. If I could make such jokes as that
      priest was, I should set up for a humorist at once. He had the touch of
      pathos that they say all true pieces of humor ought to have,&rdquo; he went on
      instinctively addressing himself to Miss Vervain, who did not repulse him.
      &ldquo;He made me melancholy; and his face haunts me. I should like to paint
      him. Priests are generally such a snuffy, common lot. And I dare say,&rdquo; he
      concluded, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sufficiently commonplace, too, though he didn&rsquo;t look it.
      Spare your romance, Miss Vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady blushed resentfully. &ldquo;I see as little romance as joke in
      it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a cannon,&rdquo; returned Ferris, without taking any notice of her, and
      with a sort of absent laugh, &ldquo;that would make it very lively for the
      Southerners&mdash;if they had it. Poor fellow! I suppose he came with high
      hopes of me, and expected me to receive his invention with eloquent
      praises. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he figured himself furnished not only with a
      passport, but with a letter from me to President Lincoln, and foresaw his
      own triumphal entry into Washington, and his honorable interviews with the
      admiring generals of the Union forces, to whom he should display his
      wonderful cannon. Too bad; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you give him the passport and the letter?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a state secret,&rdquo; returned Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think he won&rsquo;t do for our purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure of it. Tell me something more about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything more about him. Besides, there isn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gondola had already entered the canal, and was swiftly approaching the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, there is,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Vervain, laying her hand on his arm. &ldquo;I
      want you to come in and dine with us. We dine early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I can&rsquo;t. Affairs of the nation, you know. Rebel privateer on
      the canal of the Brenta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Mrs. Vervain leaned towards Ferris for sharper scrutiny of his
      face. Her glasses sprang from her nose, and precipitated themselves into
      his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; he said, with burlesque politeness, withdrawing them from the
      recesses of his waistcoat and gravely presenting them. Miss Vervain burst
      into a helpless laugh; then she turned toward her mother with a kind of
      indignant tenderness, and gently arranged her shawl so that it should not
      drop off when she rose to leave the gondola. She did not look again at
      Ferris, who resisted Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s entreaties to remain, and took leave
      as soon as the gondola landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies went to their room, where Florida lifted from the table a vase
      of divers-colored hyacinths, and stepping out upon the balcony flung the
      flowers into the canal. As she put down the empty vase, the lingering
      perfume of the banished flowers haunted the air of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Florida,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;those were the flowers that Mr. Ferris
      gave you. Did you fancy they had begun to decay? The smell of hyacinths
      when they&rsquo;re a little old is dreadful. But I can&rsquo;t imagine a gentleman&rsquo;s
      giving you flowers that were at all old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, don&rsquo;t speak to me!&rdquo; cried Miss Vervain, passionately,
      clasping her hands to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I see that I&rsquo;ve been saying something to vex you, my darling,&rdquo; and
      seating herself beside the young girl on the sofa, she fondly took down
      her hands. &ldquo;Do tell me what it was. Was it about your teachers falling in
      love with you? You know they did, Florida: Pestachiavi and Schulze, both;
      and that horrid old Fleuron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I liked any better on that account to have you talk it over
      with a stranger?&rdquo; asked Florida, still angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, penitently. &ldquo;But if it worried
      you, why didn&rsquo;t you do something to stop me? Give me a hint, or just a
      little knock, somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother; I&rsquo;d rather not. Then you&rsquo;d have come out with the whole
      thing, to prove that you were right. It&rsquo;s better to let it go,&rdquo; said
      Florida with a fierce laugh, half sob. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s strange that you can&rsquo;t
      remember how such things torment me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s my weak health, dear,&rdquo; answered the mother. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use
      to be so. But now I don&rsquo;t really seem to have the strength to be sensible.
      I know it&rsquo;s silly as well as you. The talk just seems to keep going on of
      itself,&mdash;slipping out, slipping out. But you needn&rsquo;t mind. Mr. Ferris
      won&rsquo;t think you could ever have done anything out of the way. I&rsquo;m sure you
      don&rsquo;t act with <i>him</i> as if you&rsquo;d ever encouraged anybody. I think
      you&rsquo;re too haughty with him, Florida. And now, his flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s detestable. He&rsquo;s conceited and presuming beyond all endurance. I
      don&rsquo;t care what he thinks of me. But it&rsquo;s his manner towards you that I
      can&rsquo;t tolerate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s rather free,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;But then you know, my
      dear, I shall be soon getting to be an old lady; and besides, I always
      feel as if consuls were a kind of one of the family. He&rsquo;s been very
      obliging since we came; I don&rsquo;t know what we should have done without him.
      And I don&rsquo;t object to a little ease of manner in the gentlemen; I never
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes fun of you,&rdquo; cried Florida: &ldquo;and there at the convent,&rdquo;, she
      said, bursting into angry tears, &ldquo;he kept exchanging glances with that
      monk as if he.... He&rsquo;s insulting, and I hate him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he thought your mother ridiculous, Florida?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Vervain gravely. &ldquo;You must have misunderstood his looks; indeed you must.
      I can&rsquo;t imagine why he should. I remember that I talked particularly well
      during our whole visit; my mind was active, for I felt unusually strong,
      and I was interested in everything. It&rsquo;s nothing but a fancy of yours; or
      your prejudice, Florida. But it&rsquo;s odd, now I&rsquo;ve sat down for a moment, how
      worn out I feel. And thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain fitted on her glasses, but even then felt uncertainly about
      for the empty vase on the table before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a goblet, mother,&rdquo; said Florida; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do; and then throw a shawl over me. I&rsquo;m sleepy, and a nap before dinner
      will do me good. I don&rsquo;t see why I&rsquo;m so drowsy of late. I suppose it&rsquo;s
      getting into the sea air here at Venice; though it&rsquo;s mountain air that
      makes you drowsy. But you&rsquo;re quite mistaken about Mr. Ferris. He isn&rsquo;t
      capable of anything really rude. Besides, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
      sense in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl brought the water and then knelt beside the sofa, on which
      she arranged the pillows under her mother, and covered her with soft
      wraps. She laid her cheek against the thinner face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind anything
      I&rsquo;ve said, mother; let&rsquo;s talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother drew some loose threads of the daughter&rsquo;s hair through her
      slender fingers, but said little more, and presently fell into a deep
      slumber. Florida gently lifted her head away, and remained kneeling before
      the sofa, looking into the sleeping face with an expression of strenuous,
      compassionate devotion, mixed with a vague alarm and self-pity, and a
      certain wondering anxiety.

      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito had slept upon his interview with Ferris, and now sat in his
      laboratory, amidst the many witnesses of his inventive industry, with the
      model of the breech-loading cannon on the workbench before him. He had
      neatly mounted it on wheels, that its completeness might do him the
      greater credit with the consul when he should show it him, but the
      carriage had been broken in his pocket, on the way home, by an unlucky
      thrust from the burden of a porter, and the poor toy lay there disabled,
      as if to dramatize that premature explosion in the secret chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was in these inventions of his, which had as yet so grudgingly
      repaid his affection. For their sake he had stinted himself of many
      needful things. The meagre stipend which he received from the patrimony of
      his church, eked out with the money paid him for baptisms, funerals, and
      marriages, and for masses by people who had friends to be prayed out of
      purgatory, would at best have barely sufficed to support him; but he
      denied himself everything save the necessary decorums of dress and
      lodging; he fasted like a saint, and slept hard as a hermit, that he might
      spend upon these ungrateful creatures of his brain. They were the work of
      his own hands, and so he saved the expense of their construction; but
      there were many little outlays for materials and for tools, which he could
      not avoid, and with him a little was all. They not only famished him; they
      isolated him. His superiors in the church, and his brother priests, looked
      with doubt or ridicule upon the labors for which he shunned their company,
      while he gave up the other social joys, few and small, which a priest
      might know in the Venice of that day, when all generous spirits regarded
      him with suspicion for his cloth&rsquo;s sake, and church and state were alert
      to detect disaffection or indifference in him. But bearing these things
      willingly, and living as frugally as he might, he had still not enough,
      and he had been fain to assume the instruction of a young girl of old and
      noble family in certain branches of polite learning which a young lady of
      that sort might fitly know. The family was not so rich as it was old and
      noble, and Don Ippolito was paid from its purse rather than its pride. But
      the slender salary was a help; these patricians were very good to him;
      many a time he dined with them, and so spared the cost of his own pottage
      at home; they always gave him coffee when he came, and that was a saving;
      at the proper seasons little presents from them were not wanting. In a
      word, his condition was not privation. He did his duty as a teacher
      faithfully, and the only trouble with it was that the young girl was
      growing into a young woman, and that he could not go on teaching her
      forever. In an evil hour, as it seemed to Don Ippolito, that made the
      years she had been his pupil shrivel to a mere pinch of time, there came
      from a young count of the Friuli, visiting Venice, an offer of marriage;
      and Don Ippolito lost his place. It was hard, but he bade himself have
      patience; and he composed an ode for the nuptials of his late pupil,
      which, together with a brief sketch of her ancestral history, he had
      elegantly printed, according to the Italian usage, and distributed among
      the family friends; he also made a sonnet to the bridegroom, and these
      literary tributes were handsomely acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He managed a whole year upon the proceeds, and kept a cheerful spirit till
      the last soldo was spent, inventing one thing after another, and giving
      much time and money to a new principle of steam propulsion, which, as
      applied without steam to a small boat on the canal before his door, failed
      to work, though it had no logical excuse for its delinquency. He tried to
      get other pupils, but he got none, and he began to dream of going to
      America. He pinned his faith in all sorts of magnificent possibilities to
      the names of Franklin, Fulton, and Morse; he was so ignorant of our
      politics and geography as to suppose us at war with the South American
      Spaniards, but he knew that English was the language of the North, and he
      applied himself to the study of it. Heaven only knows what kind of
      inventor&rsquo;s Utopia, our poor, patent-ridden country appeared to him in
      these dreams of his, and I can but dimly figure it to myself. But he might
      very naturally desire to come to a land where the spirit of invention is
      recognized and fostered, and where he could hope to find that comfort of
      incentive and companionship which our artists find in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of the breech-loading cannon had occurred to him suddenly one
      day, in one of his New-World-ward reveries, and he had made haste to
      realize it, carefully studying the form and general effect of the Austrian
      cannon under the gallery of the Ducal Palace, to the high embarrassment of
      the Croat sentry who paced up and down there, and who did not feel free to
      order off a priest as he would a civilian. Don Ippolito&rsquo;s model was of
      admirable finish; he even painted the carriage yellow and black, because
      that of the original was so, and colored the piece to look like brass; and
      he lost a day while the paint was drying, after he was otherwise ready to
      show it to the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had parted from Ferris with some gleams of comfort, caught chiefly from
      his kindly manner, but they had died away before nightfall, and this
      morning he could not rekindle them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had his coffee served to him on the bench, as his frequent custom
      was, but it stood untasted in the little copper pot beside the dismounted
      cannon, though it was now ten o&rsquo;clock, and it was full time he had
      breakfasted, for he had risen early to perform the matin service for three
      peasant women, two beggars, a cat, and a paralytic nobleman, in the
      ancient and beautiful church to which he was attached. He had tried to go
      about his wonted occupations, but he was still sitting idle before his
      bench, while his servant gossiped from her balcony to the mistress of the
      next house, across a calle so deep and narrow that it opened like a
      mountain chasm beneath them. &ldquo;It were well if the master read his breviary
      a little more, instead of always maddening himself with those blessed
      inventions, that eat more soldi than a Christian, and never come to
      anything. There he sits before his table, as if he were nailed to his
      chair, and lets his coffee cool&mdash;and God knows I was ready to drink
      it warm two hours ago&mdash;and never looks at me if I open the door
      twenty times to see whether he has finished. Holy patience! You have not
      even the advantage of fasting to the glory of God in this house, though
      you keep Lent the year round. It&rsquo;s the Devil&rsquo;s Lent, <i>I</i> say. Eh,
      Diana! There goes the bell. Who now? Adieu, Lusetta. To meet again, dear.
      Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to another window, and admitted the visitor. It was Ferris, and
      she went to announce him to her master by the title he had given, while he
      amused his leisure in the darkness below by falling over a cistern-top,
      with a loud clattering of his cane on the copper lid, after which he heard
      the voice of the priest begging him to remain at his convenience a moment
      till he could descend and show him the way upstairs. His eyes were not yet
      used to the obscurity of the narrow entry in which he stood, when he felt
      a cold hand laid on his, and passively yielded himself to its guidance. He
      tried to excuse himself for intruding upon Don Ippolito so soon, but the
      priest in far suppler Italian overwhelmed him with lamentations that he
      should be so unworthy the honor done him, and ushered his guest into his
      apartment. He plainly took it for granted that Ferris had come to see his
      inventions, in compliance with the invitation he had given him the day
      before, and he made no affectation of delay, though after the excitement
      of the greetings was past, it was with a quiet dejection that he rose and
      offered to lead his visitor to his laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole place was an outgrowth of himself; it was his history as well as
      his character. It recorded his quaint and childish tastes, his restless
      endeavors, his partial and halting successes. The ante-room in which he
      had paused with Ferris was painted to look like a grape-arbor, where the
      vines sprang from the floor, and flourishing up the trellised walls, with
      many a wanton tendril and flaunting leaf, displayed their lavish clusters
      of white and purple all over the ceiling. It touched Ferris, when Don
      Ippolito confessed that this decoration had been the distraction of his
      own vacant moments, to find that it was like certain grape-arbors he had
      seen in remote corners of Venice before the doors of degenerate palaces,
      or forming the entrances of open-air restaurants, and did not seem at all
      to have been studied from grape-arbors in the country. He perceived the
      archaic striving for exact truth, and he successfully praised the
      mechanical skill and love of reality with which it was done; but he was
      silenced by a collection of paintings in Don Ippolito&rsquo;s parlor, where he
      had been made to sit down a moment. Hard they were in line, fixed in
      expression, and opaque in color, these copies of famous masterpieces,&mdash;saints
      of either sex, ascensions, assumptions, martyrdoms, and what not,&mdash;and
      they were not quite comprehensible till Don Ippolito explained that he had
      made them from such prints of the subjects as he could get, and had
      colored them after his own fancy. All this, in a city whose art had been
      the glory of the world for nigh half a thousand years, struck Ferris as
      yet more comically pathetic than the frescoed grape-arbor; he stared about
      him for some sort of escape from the pictures, and his eye fell upon a
      piano and a melodeon placed end to end in a right angle. Don Ippolito,
      seeing his look of inquiry, sat down and briefly played the same air with
      a hand upon each instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris smiled. &ldquo;Don Ippolito, you are another Da Vinci, a universal
      genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bagatelles, bagatelles,&rdquo; said the priest pensively; but he rose with
      greater spirit than he had yet shown, and preceded the consul into the
      little room that served him for a smithy. It seemed from some
      peculiarities of shape to have once been an oratory, but it was now
      begrimed with smoke and dust from the forge which Don Ippolito had set up
      in it; the embers of a recent fire, the bellows, the pincers, the hammers,
      and the other implements of the trade, gave it a sinister effect, as if
      the place of prayer had been invaded by mocking imps, or as if some
      hapless mortal in contract with the evil powers were here searching, by
      the help of the adversary, for the forbidden secrets of the metals and of
      fire. In those days, Ferris was an uncompromising enemy of the
      theatricalization of Italy, or indeed of anything; but the fancy of the
      black-robed young priest at work in this place appealed to him all the
      more potently because of the sort of tragic innocence which seemed to
      characterize Don Ippolito&rsquo;s expression. He longed intensely to sketch the
      picture then and there, but he had strength to rebuke the fancy as
      something that could not make itself intelligible without the help of such
      accessories as he despised, and he victoriously followed the priest into
      his larger workshop, where his inventions, complete and incomplete, were
      stored, and where he had been seated when his visitor arrived. The high
      windows and the frescoed ceiling were festooned with dusty cobwebs; litter
      of shavings and whittlings strewed the floor; mechanical implements and
      contrivances were everywhere, and Don Ippolito&rsquo;s listlessness seemed to
      return upon him again at the sight of the familiar disorder. Conspicuous
      among other objects lay the illogically unsuccessful model of the new
      principle of steam propulsion, untouched since the day when he had lifted
      it out of the canal and carried it indoors through the ranks of grinning
      spectators. From a shelf above it he took down models of a flying-machine
      and a perpetual motion. &ldquo;Fantastic researches in the impossible. I never
      expected results from these experiments, with which I nevertheless once
      pleased myself,&rdquo; he said, and turned impatiently to various pieces of
      portable furniture, chairs, tables, bedsteads, which by folding up their
      legs and tops condensed themselves into flat boxes, developing handles at
      the side for convenience in carrying. They were painted and varnished, and
      were in all respects complete; they had indeed won favorable mention at an
      exposition of the Provincial Society of Arts and Industries, and Ferris
      could applaud their ingenuity sincerely, though he had his tacit doubts of
      their usefulness. He fell silent again when Don Ippolito called his notice
      to a photographic camera, so contrived with straps and springs that you
      could snatch by its help whatever joy there might be in taking your own
      photograph; and he did not know what to say of a submarine boat, a
      four-wheeled water-velocipede, a movable bridge, or the very many other
      principles and ideas to which Don Ippolito&rsquo;s cunning hand had given shape,
      more or less imperfect. It seemed to him that they all, however perfect or
      imperfect, had some fatal defect: they were aspirations toward the
      impossible, or realizations of the trivial and superfluous. Yet, for all
      this, they strongly appealed to the painter as the stunted fruit of a
      talent denied opportunity, instruction, and sympathy. As he looked from
      them at last to the questioning face of the priest, and considered out of
      what disheartened and solitary patience they must have come in this city,&mdash;dead
      hundreds of years to all such endeavor,&mdash;he could not utter some glib
      phrases of compliment that he had on his tongue. If Don Ippolito had been
      taken young, he might perhaps have amounted to something, though this was
      questionable; but at thirty&mdash;as he looked now,&mdash;with his
      undisciplined purposes, and his head full of vagaries of which these
      things were the tangible witness.... Ferris let his eyes drop again. They
      fell upon the ruin of the breech-loading cannon, and he said, &ldquo;Don
      Ippolito, it&rsquo;s very good of you to take the trouble of showing me these
      matters, and I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon the ungrateful return, if I cannot offer
      any definite opinion of them now. They are rather out of my way, I
      confess. I wish with all my heart I could order an experimental, life-size
      copy of your breech-loading cannon here, for trial by my government, but I
      can&rsquo;t; and to tell you the truth, it was not altogether the wish to see
      these inventions of yours that brought me here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, with a mortified air, &ldquo;I am afraid that I have
      wearied the Signor Console.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; Ferris made haste to answer, with a frown at his
      own awkwardness. &ldquo;But your speaking English yesterday; ... perhaps what I
      was thinking of is quite foreign to your tastes and possibilities.&rdquo;... He
      hesitated with a look of perplexity, while Don Ippolito stood before him
      in an attitude of expectation, pressing the points of his fingers
      together, and looking curiously into his face. &ldquo;The case is this,&rdquo; resumed
      Ferris desperately. &ldquo;There are two American ladies, friends of mine,
      sojourning in Venice, who expect to be here till midsummer. They are
      mother and daughter, and the young lady wants to read and speak Italian
      with somebody a few hours each day. The question is whether it is quite
      out of your way or not to give her lessons of this kind. I ask it quite at
      a venture. I suppose no harm is done, at any rate,&rdquo; and he looked at Don
      Ippolito with apologetic perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;there is no harm. On the contrary, I am at this
      moment in a position to consider it a great favor that you do me in
      offering me this employment. I accept it with the greatest pleasure. Oh!&rdquo;
       he cried, breaking by a sudden impulse from the composure with which he
      had begun to speak, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you do for me; you lift me out of
      despair. Before you came, I had reached one of those passes that seem the
      last bound of endeavor. But you give me new life. Now I can go on with my
      experiment. I can attest my gratitude by possessing your native country
      of the weapon I had designed for it&mdash;I am sure of the principle: some
      slight improvement, perhaps the use of some different explosive, would get
      over that difficulty you suggested,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;Yes, something can
      be done. God bless you, my dear little son&mdash;I mean&mdash;perdoni!&mdash;my
      dear sir.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;not so fast,&rdquo; said Ferris with a laugh, yet a little annoyed
      that a question so purely tentative as his should have met at once such a
      definite response. &ldquo;Are you quite sure you can do what they want?&rdquo; He
      unfolded to him, as fully as he understood it, Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito entered into it with perfect intelligence. He said that he
      had already had charge of the education of a young girl of noble family,
      and he could therefore the more confidently hope to be useful to this
      American lady. A light of joyful hope shone in his dreamy eyes, the whole
      man changed, he assumed the hospitable and caressing host. He conducted
      Ferris back to his parlor, and making him sit upon the hard sofa that was
      his hard bed by night, he summoned his servant, and bade her serve them
      coffee. She closed her lips firmly, and waved her finger before her face,
      to signify that there was no more coffee. Then he bade her fetch it from
      the caffè: and he listened with a sort of rapt inattention while Ferris
      again returned to the subject and explained that he had approached him
      without first informing the ladies, and that he must regard nothing as
      final. It was at this point that Don Ippolito, who had understood so
      clearly what Mrs. Vervain wanted, appeared a little slow to understand;
      and Ferris had a doubt whether it was from subtlety or from simplicity
      that the priest seemed not to comprehend the impulse on which he had
      acted. He finished his coffee in this perplexity, and when he rose to go,
      Don Ippolito followed him down to the street-door, and preserved him from
      a second encounter with the cistern-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Don Ippolito&mdash;remember! I make no engagement for the ladies,
      whom you must see before anything is settled,&rdquo; said Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&mdash;surely!&rdquo; answered the priest, and he remained smiling at
      the door till the American turned the next corner. Then he went back to
      his work-room, and took up the broken model from the bench. But he could
      not work at it now, he could not work at anything; he began to walk up and
      down the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could he really have been so stupid because his mind was on his
      ridiculous cannon?&rdquo; wondered Ferris as he sauntered frowning away; and he
      tried to prepare his own mind for his meeting with the Vervains, to whom
      he must now go at once. He felt abused and victimized. Yet it was an
      amusing experience, and he found himself able to interest both of the
      ladies in it. The younger had received him as coldly as the forms of
      greeting would allow; but as he talked she drew nearer him with a
      reluctant haughtiness which he noted. He turned the more conspicuously
      towards Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;Well, to make a long story short,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t discourage Don Ippolito. He refused to be dismayed&mdash;as I
      should have been at the notion of teaching Miss Vervain. I didn&rsquo;t arrange
      with him not to fall in love with her as his secular predecessors have
      done&mdash;it seemed superfluous. But you can mention it to him if you
      like. In fact,&rdquo; said Ferris, suddenly addressing the daughter, &ldquo;you might
      make the stipulation yourself, Miss Vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a moment with a sort of defenseless pain that made him
      ashamed; and then walked away from him towards the window, with a frank
      resentment that made him smile, as he continued, &ldquo;But I suppose you would
      like to have some explanation of my motive in precipitating Don Ippolito
      upon you in this way, when I told you only yesterday that he wouldn&rsquo;t do
      at all; in fact I think myself that I&rsquo;ve behaved rather fickle-mindedly&mdash;for
      a representative of the country. But I&rsquo;ll tell you; and you won&rsquo;t be
      surprised to learn that I acted from mixed motives. I&rsquo;m not at all sure
      that he&rsquo;ll do; I&rsquo;ve had awful misgivings about it since I left him, and
      I&rsquo;m glad of the chance to make a clean breast of it. When I came to think
      the matter over last night, the fact that he had taught himself English&mdash;with
      the help of an Irishman for the pronunciation&mdash;seemed to promise that
      he&rsquo;d have the right sort of sympathy with your scheme, and it showed that
      he must have something practical about him, too. And here&rsquo;s where the
      selfish admixture comes in. I didn&rsquo;t have your interests solely in mind
      when I went to see Don Ippolito. I hadn&rsquo;t been able to get rid of him; he
      stuck in my thought. I fancied he might be glad of the pay of a teacher,
      and&mdash;I had half a notion to ask him to let me paint him. It was an
      even chance whether I should try to secure him for Miss Vervain, or for
      Art&mdash;as they call it. Miss Vervain won because she could pay him, and
      I didn&rsquo;t see how Art could. I can bring him round any time; and that&rsquo;s the
      whole inconsequent business. My consolation is that I&rsquo;ve left you
      perfectly free. There&rsquo;s nothing decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain; &ldquo;then it&rsquo;s all settled. You can bring him as
      soon as you like, to our new place. We&rsquo;ve taken that apartment we looked
      at the other day, and we&rsquo;re going into it this afternoon. Here&rsquo;s the
      landlord&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; she added, drawing a paper out of her pocket. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s
      cheated us, I suppose you can see justice done. I didn&rsquo;t want to trouble
      you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman of business, Mrs. Vervain,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a
      perfect Jew&mdash;or a perfect Christian, one ought to say in Venice; we
      true believers do gouge so much, more infamously here&mdash;and you let
      him get you in black and white before you come to me. Well,&rdquo; he continued,
      as he glanced at the paper, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done it! He makes you pay one half too
      much. However, it&rsquo;s cheap enough; twice as cheap as your hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care for cheapness. I hate to be imposed upon. What&rsquo;s to be
      done about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; if he has your letter as you have his. It&rsquo;s a bargain, and you
      must stand to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bargain? Oh nonsense, now, Mr. Ferris. This is merely a note of mutual
      understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one way of looking at it. The Civil Tribunal would call it a
      binding agreement of the closest tenure,&mdash;if you want to go to law
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> go to law about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, you won&rsquo;t&mdash;unless you mean to spend your remaining days and
      all your substance in Venice. Come, you haven&rsquo;t done so badly, Mrs.
      Vervain. I don&rsquo;t call four rooms, completely furnished for housekeeping,
      with that lovely garden, at all dear at eleven francs a day. Besides, the
      landlord is a man of excellent feeling, sympathetic and obliging, and a
      perfect gentleman, though he is such an outrageous scoundrel. He&rsquo;ll cheat
      you, of course, in whatever he can; you must look out for that; but he&rsquo;ll
      do you any sort of little neighborly kindness. Good-by,&rdquo; said Ferris,
      getting to the door before Mrs. Vervain could intercept him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to
      your new place this evening to see how you are pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florida,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;this is outrageous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it, mother. We pay very little, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we pay too much. That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t bear. And as you said
      yesterday, I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s manners are quite respectful to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only told you the truth; I think he advised you for the best. The
      matter couldn&rsquo;t be helped now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I call it a want of feeling to speak the truth so bluntly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to complain of that in our landlord, it seems,&rdquo; said
      Florida. &ldquo;Perhaps not in our priest, either,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that <i>was</i> kind of Mr. Ferris,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;It was
      thoroughly thoughtful and considerate&mdash;what I call an instance of
      true delicacy. I&rsquo;m really quite curious to see him. Don Ippolito! How very
      odd to call a priest <i>Don</i>! I should have said Padre. Don always
      makes you think of a Spanish cavalier. Don Rodrigo: something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on to talk, desultorily, of Don Ippolito, and what he might be
      like. In speaking of him the day before, Ferris had hinted at some
      mysterious sadness in him; and to hint of sadness in a man always
      interests women in him, whether they are old or young: the old have
      suffered, the young forebode suffering. Their interest in Don Ippolito had
      not been diminished by what Ferris had told them of his visit to the
      priest&rsquo;s house and of the things he had seen there; for there had always
      been the same strain of pity in his laughing account, and he had imparted
      none of his doubts to them. They did not talk as if it were strange that
      Ferris should do to-day what he had yesterday said he would not do;
      perhaps as women they could not find such a thing strange; but it vexed
      him more and more as he went about all afternoon thinking of his
      inconsistency, and wondering whether he had not acted rashly.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The palace in which Mrs. Vervain had taken an apartment fronted on a broad
      campo, and hung its empty marble balconies from gothic windows above a
      silence scarcely to be matched elsewhere in Venice. The local pharmacy,
      the caffè, the grocery, the fruiterer&rsquo;s, the other shops with which every
      Venetian campo is furnished, had each a certain life about it, but it was
      a silent life, and at midday a frowsy-headed woman clacking across the
      flags in her wooden-heeled shoes made echoes whose garrulity was
      interrupted by no other sound. In the early morning, when the lid of the
      public cistern in the centre of the campo was unlocked, there was a clamor
      of voices and a clangor of copper vessels, as the housewives of the
      neighborhood and the local force of strong-backed Frinlan water-girls drew
      their day&rsquo;s supply of water; and on that sort of special parochial
      holiday, called a <i>sagra</i>, the campo hummed and clattered and
      shrieked with a multitude celebrating the day around the stands where
      pumpkin seeds and roast pumpkin and anisette-water were sold, and before
      the movable kitchen where cakes were fried in caldrons of oil, and
      uproariously offered to the crowd by the cook, who did not suffer himself
      to be embarrassed by the rival drama of adjoining puppet-shows, but
      continued to bellow forth his bargains all day long and far into the
      night, when the flames under his kettles painted his visage a fine
      crimson. The sagra once over, however, the campo relapsed into its
      habitual silence, and no one looking at the front of the palace would have
      thought of it as a place for distraction-seeking foreign sojourners. But
      it was not on this side that the landlord tempted his tenants; his
      principal notice of lodgings to let was affixed to the water-gate of the
      palace, which opened on a smaller channel so near the Grand Canal that no
      wandering eye could fail to see it. The portal was a tall arch of Venetian
      gothic tipped with a carven flame; steps of white Istrian stone descended
      to the level of the lowest ebb, irregularly embossed with barnacles, and
      dabbling long fringes of soft green sea-mosses in the rising and falling
      tide. Swarms of water-bugs and beetles played over the edges of the steps,
      and crabs scuttled side-wise into deeper water at the approach of a
      gondola. A length of stone-capped brick wall, to which patches of stucco
      still clung, stretched from the gate on either hand under cover of an ivy
      that flung its mesh of shining green from within, where there lurked a
      lovely garden, stately, spacious for Venice, and full of a delicious,
      half-sad surprise for whoso opened upon it. In the midst it had a broken
      fountain, with a marble naiad standing on a shell, and looking saucier
      than the sculptor meant, from having lost the point of her nose, nymphs
      and fauns, and shepherds and shepherdesses, her kinsfolk, coquetted in and
      out among the greenery in flirtation not to be embarrassed by the fracture
      of an arm, or the casting of a leg or so; one lady had no head, but she
      was the boldest of all. In this garden there were some mulberry and
      pomegranate trees, several of which hung about the fountain with seats in
      their shade, and for the rest there seemed to be mostly roses and
      oleanders, with other shrubs of a kind that made the greatest show of
      blossom and cost the least for tendance. A wide terrace stretched across
      the rear of the palace, dropping to the garden path by a flight of
      balustraded steps, and upon this terrace opened the long windows of Mrs.
      Vervain&rsquo;s parlor and dining-room. Her landlord owned only the first story
      and the basement of the palace, in some corner of which he cowered with
      his servants, his taste for pictures and <i>bric-à-brac</i>, and his
      little branch of inquiry into Venetian history, whatever it was, ready to
      let himself or anything he had for hire at a moment&rsquo;s notice, but very
      pleasant, gentle, and unobtrusive; a cheat and a liar, but of a kind heart
      and sympathetic manners. Under his protection Mrs. Vervain set up her
      impermanent household gods. The apartment was taken only from week to
      week, and as she freely explained to the <i>padrone</i> hovering about
      with offers of service, she knew herself too well ever to unpack anything
      that would not spoil by remaining packed. She made her trunks yield all
      the appliances necessary for an invalid&rsquo;s comfort, and then left them in a
      state to be strapped and transported to the station within half a day
      after the desire of change or the exigencies of her feeble health caused
      her going. Everything for housekeeping was furnished with the rooms. There
      was a gondolier and a sort of house-servant in the employ of the landlord,
      of whom Mrs. Vervain hired them, and she caressingly dismissed the padrone
      at an early moment after her arrival, with the charge to find a maid for
      herself and daughter. As if she had been waiting at the next door this
      maid appeared promptly, and being Venetian, and in domestic service, her
      name was of course Nina. Mrs. Vervain now said to Florida that everything
      was perfect, and contentedly began her life in Venice by telling Mr.
      Ferris, when he came in the evening, that he could bring Don Ippolito the
      day after the morrow, if he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Florida sat on the terrace waiting for them on the morning named,
      when Ferris, with the priest in his clerical best, came up the garden path
      in the sunny light. Don Ippolito&rsquo;s best was a little poverty-stricken; he
      had faltered a while, before leaving home, over the sad choice between a
      shabby cylinder hat of obsolete fashion and his well-worn three-cornered
      priestly beaver, and had at last put on the latter with a sigh. He had
      made his servant polish the buckles of his shoes, and instead of a band of
      linen round his throat, he wore a strip of cloth covered with small white
      beads, edged above and below with a single row of pale blue ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he mounted the steps with Ferris, Mrs. Vervain came forward a little to
      meet them, while Florida rose and stood beside her chair in a sort of
      proud suspense and timidity. The elder lady was in that black from which
      she had so seldom been able to escape; but the daughter wore a dress of
      delicate green, in which she seemed a part of the young season that
      everywhere clothed itself in the same tint. The sunlight fell upon her
      blonde hair, melting into its light gold; her level brows frowned somewhat
      with the glance of scrutiny which she gave the dark young priest, who was
      making his stately bow to her mother, and trying to answer her English
      greetings in the same tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, and Don Ippolito made another low bow,
      and then looked at the girl with a sort of frank and melancholy wonder, as
      she turned and exchanged a few words with Ferris, who was assailing her
      seriousness and hauteur with unabashed levity of compliment. A quick light
      flashed and fled in her cheek as she talked, and the fringes of her
      serious, asking eyes swept slowly up and down as she bent them upon him a
      moment before she broke abruptly, not coquettishly, away from him, and
      moved towards her mother, while Ferris walked off to the other end of the
      terrace, with a laugh. Mrs. Vervain and the priest were trying each other
      in French, and not making great advance; he explained to Florida in
      Italian, and she answered him hesitatingly; whereupon he praised her
      Italian in set phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the girl sincerely, &ldquo;I have tried to learn. I hope,&rdquo; she
      added as before, &ldquo;you can make me see how little I know.&rdquo; The deprecating
      wave of the hand with which Don Ippolito appealed to her from herself,
      seemed arrested midway by his perception of some novel quality in her. He
      said gravely that he should try to be of use, and then the two stood
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Ferris,&rdquo; called out Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;breakfast is ready, and I
      want you to take me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much honor,&rdquo; said the painter, coming forward and offering his arm,
      and Mrs. Vervain led the way indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to have taken Don Ippolito&rsquo;s arm,&rdquo; she confided in
      under-tone, &ldquo;but the fact is, our French is so unlike that we don&rsquo;t
      understand each other very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned Ferris, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Italians and Americans whom Frenchmen
      themselves couldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s an American breakfast,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain with a critical
      glance at the table before she sat down. &ldquo;All but hot bread; <i>that</i>
      you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> have,&rdquo; and Don Ippolito was for the first time in his
      life confronted by a breakfast of hot beef-steak, eggs and toast, fried
      potatoes, and coffee with milk, with a choice of tea. He subdued all signs
      of the wonder he must have felt, and beyond cutting his meat into little
      bits before eating it, did nothing to betray his strangeness to the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast had passed off very pleasantly, with occasional lapses. &ldquo;We
      break down under the burden of so many languages,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;It is an
      <i>embarras de richesses</i>. Let us fix upon a common maccheronic. May I
      trouble you for a poco piú di sugar dans mon café, Mrs. Vervain? What do
      you think of the bellazza de ce weather magnifique, Don Ippolito?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain in a tone of fond admiration aside to
      Don Ippolito, who smiled, but shrank from contributing to the new tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the painter. &ldquo;I shall stick to my native Bergamask
      for the future; and Don Ippolito may translate for the foreign ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended by speaking English with everybody; Don Ippolito eked out his
      speeches to Mrs. Vervain in that tongue with a little French; Florida,
      conscious of Ferris&rsquo;s ironical observance, used an embarrassed but defiant
      Italian with the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased!&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, rising when Ferris said that he must
      go, and Florida shook hands with both guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Vervain; I could have gone before, if I&rsquo;d thought you
      would have liked it,&rdquo; answered the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nonsense, now,&rdquo; returned the lady. &ldquo;You know what I mean. I&rsquo;m
      perfectly delighted with him,&rdquo; she continued, getting Ferris to one side,
      &ldquo;and I <i>know</i> he must have a good accent. So very kind of you. Will
      you arrange with him about the pay?&mdash;such a <i>shame</i>! Thanks.
      Then I needn&rsquo;t say anything to him about that. I&rsquo;m so glad I had him to
      breakfast the first day; though Florida thought not. Of course, one
      needn&rsquo;t keep it up. But seriously, it isn&rsquo;t an ordinary case, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris laughed at her with a sort of affectionate disrespect, and said
      good-by. Don Ippolito lingered for a while to talk over the proposed
      lessons, and then went, after more elaborate adieux. Mrs. Vervain remained
      thoughtful a moment before she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was rather droll, Florida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His cutting his meat into small bites, before he began to eat. But
      perhaps it&rsquo;s the Venetian custom. At any rate, my dear, he&rsquo;s a gentleman
      in virtue of his profession, and I couldn&rsquo;t do less than ask him to
      breakfast. He has beautiful manners; and if he must take snuff, I suppose
      it&rsquo;s neater to carry two handkerchiefs, though it does look odd. I wish he
      wouldn&rsquo;t take snuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we need care, mother. At any rate, we cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, my dear. And his nails. Now when they&rsquo;re spread out on a
      book, you know, to keep it open,&mdash;won&rsquo;t it be unpleasant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to have just such fingernails all over Europe&mdash;except in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I know it. I dare say we shouldn&rsquo;t care for it in him, if he
      didn&rsquo;t seem so very nice otherwise. How handsome he is!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was understood that Don Ippolito should come every morning at ten
      o&rsquo;clock, and read and talk with Miss Vervain for an hour or two; but Mrs.
      Vervain&rsquo;s hospitality was too aggressive for the letter of the agreement.
      She oftener had him to breakfast at nine, for, as she explained to Ferris,
      she could not endure to have him feel that it was a mere mercenary
      transaction, and there was no limit fixed for the lessons on these days.
      When she could, she had Ferris come, too, and she missed him when he did
      not come. &ldquo;I like that bluntness of his,&rdquo; she professed to her daughter,
      &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mind his making light of me. You are so apt to be heavy if
      you&rsquo;re not made light of occasionally. I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t want a <i>son</i>
      to be so respectful and obedient as you are, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter honestly returned her fondness, and with not much greater
      reason. He saw that she took pleasure in his talk, and enjoyed it even
      when she did not understand it; and this is a kind of flattery not easy to
      resist. Besides, there was very little ladies&rsquo; society in Venice in those
      times, and Ferris, after trying the little he could get at, had gladly
      denied himself its pleasures, and consorted with the young men he met at
      the caffè&rsquo;s, or in the Piazza. But when the Vervains came, they recalled
      to him the younger days in which he had delighted in the companionship of
      women. After so long disuse, it was charming to be with a beautiful girl
      who neither regarded him with distrust nor expected him to ask her in
      marriage because he sat alone with her, rode out with her in a gondola,
      walked with her, read with her. All young men like a house in which no ado
      is made about their coming and going, and Mrs. Vervain perfectly
      understood the art of letting him make himself at home. He perceived with
      amusement that this amiable lady, who never did an ungraceful thing nor
      wittingly said an ungracious one, was very much of a Bohemian at heart,&mdash;the
      gentlest and most blameless of the tribe, but still lawless,&mdash;whether
      from her campaigning married life, or the rovings of her widowhood, or by
      natural disposition; and that Miss Vervain was inclined to be
      conventionally strict, but with her irregular training was at a loss for
      rules by which to check her mother&rsquo;s little waywardnesses. Her anxious
      perplexity, at times, together with her heroic obedience and unswerving
      loyalty to her mother had something pathetic as well as amusing in it. He
      saw her tried almost to tears by her mother&rsquo;s helpless frankness,&mdash;for
      Mrs. Vervain was apparently one of those ladies whom the intolerable
      surprise of having anything come into their heads causes instantly to say
      or do it,&mdash;and he observed that she never tried to pass off her
      endurance with any feminine arts; but seemed to defy him to think what he
      would of it. Perhaps she was not able to do otherwise: he thought of her
      at times as a person wholly abandoned to the truth. Her pride was on the
      alert against him; she may have imagined that he was covertly smiling at
      her, and she no doubt tasted the ironical flavor of much of his talk and
      behavior, for in those days he liked to qualify his devotion to the
      Vervains with a certain nonchalant slight, which, while the mother openly
      enjoyed it, filled the daughter with anger and apprehension. Quite at
      random, she visited points of his informal manner with unmeasured
      reprisal; others, for which he might have blamed himself, she passed over
      with strange caprice. Sometimes this attitude of hers provoked him, and
      sometimes it disarmed him; but whether they were at feud, or keeping an
      armed truce, or, as now and then happened, were in an <i>entente cordiale</i>
      which he found very charming, the thing that he always contrived to treat
      with silent respect and forbearance in Miss Vervain was that sort of
      aggressive tenderness with which she hastened to shield the foibles of her
      mother. That was something very good in her pride, he finally decided. At
      the same time, he did not pretend to understand the curious filial
      self-sacrifice which it involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing in her that puzzled him was her devoutness. Mrs. Vervain
      could with difficulty be got to church, but her daughter missed no service
      of the English ritual in the old palace where the British and American
      tourists assembled once a week with their guide-books in one pocket and
      their prayer-books in the other, and buried the tomahawk under the altar.
      Mr. Ferris was often sent with her; and then his thoughts, which were a
      young man&rsquo;s, wandered from the service to the beautiful girl at his side,&mdash;the
      golden head that punctiliously bowed itself at the proper places in the
      liturgy: the full lips that murmured the responses; the silken lashes that
      swept her pale cheeks as she perused the morning lesson. He knew that the
      Vervains were not Episcopalians when at home, for Mrs. Vervain had told
      him so, and that Florida went to the English service because there was no
      other. He conjectured that perhaps her touch of ritualism came from mere
      love of any form she could make sure of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants in Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s lightly ordered household, with the
      sympathetic quickness of the Italians, learned to use him as the next
      friend of the family, and though they may have had their decorous surprise
      at his untrammeled footing, they probably excused the whole relation as a
      phase of that foreign eccentricity to which their nation is so amiable. If
      they were not able to cast the same mantle of charity over Don Ippolito&rsquo;s
      allegiance,&mdash;and doubtless they had their reserves concerning such
      frankly familiar treatment of so dubious a character as priest,&mdash;still
      as a priest they stood somewhat in awe of him; they had the spontaneous
      loyalty of their race to the people they served, and they never intimated
      by a look that they found it strange when Don Ippolito freely came and
      went. Mrs. Vervain had quite adopted him into her family; while her
      daughter seemed more at ease with him than with Ferris, and treated him
      with a grave politeness which had something also of compassion and of
      child-like reverence in it. Ferris observed that she was always
      particularly careful of his supposable sensibilities as a Roman Catholic,
      and that the priest was oddly indifferent to this deference, as if it
      would have mattered very little to him whether his church was spared or
      not. He had a way of lightly avoiding, Ferris fancied, not only religious
      points on which they could disagree, but all phases of religion as matters
      of indifference. At such times Miss Vervain relaxed her reverential
      attitude, and used him with something like rebuke, as if it did not please
      her to have the representative of even an alien religion slight his
      office; as if her respect were for his priesthood and her compassion for
      him personally. That was rather hard for Don Ippolito, Ferris thought, and
      waited to see him snubbed outright some day, when he should behave without
      sufficient gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blossoms came and went upon the pomegranate and almond trees in the
      garden, and some of the earliest roses were in their prime; everywhere was
      so full leaf that the wantonest of the strutting nymphs was forced into a
      sort of decent seclusion, but the careless naiad of the fountain burnt in
      sunlight that subtly increased its fervors day by day, and it was no
      longer beginning to be warm, it was warm, when one morning Ferris and Miss
      Vervain sat on the steps of the terrace, waiting for Don Ippolito to join
      them at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the painter was well on with the picture of Don Ippolito
      which the first sight of the priest had given him a longing to paint, and
      he had been just now talking of it with Miss Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you paint him simply as a priest?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I should think
      you would want to make him the centre of some famous or romantic scene,&rdquo;
       she added, gravely looking into his eyes as he sat with his head thrown
      back against the balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I doubt if you <i>think</i>,&rdquo; answered Ferris, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;d see that a
      Venetian priest doesn&rsquo;t need any tawdry accessories. What do you want?
      Somebody administering the extreme unction to a victim of the Council of
      Ten? A priest stepping into a confessional at the Frari&mdash;tomb of
      Canova in the distance, perspective of one of the naves, and so forth&mdash;with
      his eye on a pretty devotee coming up to unburden her conscience? I&rsquo;ve no
      patience with the follies people think and say about Venice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida stared in haughty question at the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no worse than the rest,&rdquo; he continued with indifference to her
      anger at his bluntness. &ldquo;You all think that there can be no picture of
      Venice without a gondola or a Bridge of Sighs in it. Have you ever read
      the Merchant of Venice, or Othello? There isn&rsquo;t a boat nor a bridge nor a
      canal mentioned in either of them; and yet they breathe and pulsate with
      the very life of Venice. I&rsquo;m going to try to paint a Venetian priest so
      that you&rsquo;ll know him without a bit of conventional Venice near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Shakespeare who wrote those plays,&rdquo; said Florida. Ferris bowed in
      mock suffering from her sarcasm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have some sort of symbol in
      your picture of a Venetian priest, or people will wonder why you came so
      far to paint Father O&rsquo;Brien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I shall succeed,&rdquo; Ferris answered. &ldquo;In fact I&rsquo;ve made one
      failure already, and I&rsquo;m pretty well on with a second; but the principle
      is right, all the same. I don&rsquo;t expect everybody to see the difference
      between Don Ippolito and Father O&rsquo;Brien. At any rate, what I&rsquo;m going to
      paint <i>at</i> is the lingering pagan in the man, the renunciation first
      of the inherited nature, and then of a personality that would have enjoyed
      the world. I want to show that baffled aspiration, apathetic despair, and
      rebellious longing which you caten in his face when he&rsquo;s off his guard,
      and that suppressed look which is the characteristic expression of all
      Austrian Venice. Then,&rdquo; said Ferris laughing, &ldquo;I must work in that small
      suspicion of Jesuit which there is in every priest. But it&rsquo;s quite
      possible I may make a Father O&rsquo;Brien of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t make a Don Ippolito of him,&rdquo; said Florida, after serious
      consideration of his face to see whether he was quite in earnest, &ldquo;if you
      put all that into him. He has the simplest and openest look in the world,&rdquo;
       she added warmly, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s neither pagan, nor martyr, nor rebel in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris laughed again. &ldquo;Excuse me; I don&rsquo;t think you know. I can convince
      you.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida rose, and looking down the garden path said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming;&rdquo; and as
      Don Ippolito drew near, his face lighting up with a joyous and innocent
      smile, she continued absently, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got on new stockings, and a different
      coat and hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stockings were indeed new and the hat was not the accustomed <i>nicchio</i>,
      but a new silk cylinder with a very worldly, curling brim. Don Ippolito&rsquo;s
      coat, also, was of a more mundane cut than the talare; he wore a waistcoat
      and small-clothes, meeting the stockings at the knee with a sprightly
      buckle. His person showed no traces of the snuff with which it used to be
      so plentifully dusted; in fact, he no longer took snuff in the presence of
      the ladies. The first week he had noted an inexplicable uneasiness in them
      when he drew forth that blue cotton handkerchief after the solace of a
      pinch shortly afterwards, being alone with Florida, he saw her give a
      nervous start at its appearance. He blushed violently, and put it back
      into the pocket from which he had half drawn it, and whence it never
      emerged again in her presence. The contessina his former pupil had not
      shown any aversion to Don Ippolito&rsquo;s snuff or his blue handkerchief; but
      then the contessina had never rebuked his finger-nails by the tints of
      rose and ivory with which Miss Vervain&rsquo;s hands bewildered him. It was a
      little droll how anxiously he studied the ways of these Americans, and
      conformed to them as far as he knew. His English grew rapidly in their
      society, and it happened sometimes that the only Italian in the day&rsquo;s
      lesson was what he read with Florida, for she always yielded to her
      mother&rsquo;s wish to talk, and Mrs. Vervain preferred the ease of her native
      tongue. He was Americanizing in that good lady&rsquo;s hands as fast as she
      could transform him, and he listened to her with trustful reverence, as to
      a woman of striking though eccentric mind. Yet he seemed finally to refer
      every point to Florida, as if with an intuition of steadier and stronger
      character in her; and now, as he ascended the terrace steps in his
      modified costume, he looked intently at her. She swept him from head to
      foot with a glance, and then gravely welcomed him with unchanged
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Mrs. Vervain came out through one of the long windows,
      and adjusting her glasses, said with a start, &ldquo;Why, my dear Don Ippolito,
      I shouldn&rsquo;t have known you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, madama?&rdquo; asked the priest&mdash;with a painful smile. &ldquo;Is it so
      great a change? We can wear this dress as well as the other, if we
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course it&rsquo;s very becoming and all that; but it does look so out
      of character,&rdquo; Mrs. Vervain said, leading the way to the breakfast-room.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like seeing a military man in a civil coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a great relief to lay aside the uniform now and then, mother,&rdquo;
       said Florida, as they sat down. &ldquo;I can remember that papa used to be glad
      to get out of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly wild,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;But he never seemed the same
      person. Soldiers and&mdash;clergymen&mdash;are so much more stylish in
      their own dress&mdash;not stylish, exactly, but taking; don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Don Ippolito,&rdquo; interposed Ferris, &ldquo;you had better put on your
      talare and your nicchio again. Your <i>abbate&rsquo;s</i> dress isn&rsquo;t
      acceptable, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter spoke in Italian, but Don Ippolito answered&mdash;with certain
      blunders which it would be tedious to reproduce&mdash;in his patient,
      conscientious English, half sadly, half playfully, and glancing at
      Florida, before he turned to Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;You are as rigid as the rest
      of the world, madama. I thought you would like this dress, but it seems
      that you think it a masquerade. As madamigella says, it is a relief to lay
      aside the uniform, now and then, for us who fight the spiritual enemies as
      well as for the other soldiers. There was one time, when I was younger and
      in the subdiaconate orders, that I put off the priest&rsquo;s dress altogether,
      and wore citizen&rsquo;s clothes, not an abbate&rsquo;s suit like this. We were in
      Padua, another young priest and I, my nearest and only friend, and for a
      whole night we walked about the streets in that dress, meeting the
      students, as they strolled singing through the moonlight; we went to the
      theatre and to the caffè,&mdash;we smoked cigars, all the time laughing
      and trembling to think of the tonsure under our hats. But in the morning
      we had to put on the stockings and the talare and the nicchio again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito gave a melancholy laugh. He had thrust the corner of his
      napkin into his collar; seeing that Ferris had not his so, he twitched it
      out, and made a feint of its having been all the time in his lap. Every
      one was silent as if something shocking had been said; Florida looked with
      grave rebuke at Don Ippolito, whose story affected Ferris like that of
      some girl&rsquo;s adventure in men&rsquo;s clothes. He was in terror lest Mrs. Vervain
      should be going to say it was like that; she was going to say something;
      he made haste to forestall her, and turn the talk on other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the priest came in his usual dress, and he did not again try
      to escape from it.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One afternoon, as Don Ippolito was posing to Ferris for his picture of A
      Venetian Priest, the painter asked, to make talk, &ldquo;Have you hit upon that
      new explosive yet, which is to utilize your breech-loading cannon? Or are
      you engaged upon something altogether new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other uneasily, &ldquo;I have not touched the cannon since
      that day you saw it at my house; and as for other things, I have not been
      able to put my mind to them. I have made a few trifles which I have
      ventured to offer the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris had noticed the ingenious reading-desk which Don Ippolito had
      presented to Florida, and the footstool, contrived with springs and hinges
      so that it would fold up into the compass of an ordinary portfolio, which
      Mrs. Vervain carried about with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd look, which the painter caught at and missed, came into the
      priest&rsquo;s face, as he resumed: &ldquo;I suppose it is the distraction of my new
      occupation, and of the new acquaintances&mdash;so very strange to me in
      every way&mdash;that I have made in your amiable country-women, which
      hinders me from going about anything in earnest, now that their
      munificence has enabled me to pursue my aims with greater advantages than
      ever before. But this idle mood will pass, and in the mean time I am very
      happy. They are real angels, and madama is a true original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Vervain is rather peculiar,&rdquo; said the painter, retiring a few paces
      from his picture, and quizzing it through his half-closed eyes. &ldquo;She is a
      woman who has had affliction enough to turn a stronger head than hers
      could ever have been,&rdquo; he added kindly. &ldquo;But she has the best heart in the
      world. In fact,&rdquo; he burst forth, &ldquo;she is the most extraordinary
      combination of perfect fool and perfect lady I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me; I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; blankly faltered Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t explain to you,&rdquo; answered Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence for a time, broken at last by Don Ippolito, who asked,
      &ldquo;Why do you not marry madamigella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed not to feel that there was anything out of the way in the
      question, and Ferris was too well used to the childlike directness of the
      most maneuvering of races to be surprised. Yet he was displeased, as he
      would not have been if Don Ippolito were not a priest. He was not of the
      type of priests whom the American knew from the prejudice and distrust of
      the Italians; he was alienated from his clerical fellows by all the
      objects of his life, and by a reciprocal dislike. About other priests
      there were various scandals; but Don Ippolito was like that pretty
      match-girl of the Piazza of whom it was Venetianly answered, when one
      asked if so sweet a face were not innocent, &ldquo;Oh yes, she is mad!&rdquo; He was
      of a purity so blameless that he was reputed crack-brained by the
      caffè-gossip that in Venice turns its searching light upon whomever you
      mention; and from his own association with the man Ferris perceived in him
      an apparent single-heartedness such as no man can have but the rarest of
      Italians. He was the albino of his species; a gray crow, a white fly; he
      was really this, or he knew how to seem it with an art far beyond any
      common deceit. It was the half expectation of coming sometime upon the
      lurking duplicity in Don Ippolito, that continually enfeebled the painter
      in his attempts to portray his Venetian priest, and that gave its
      undecided, unsatisfactory character to the picture before him&mdash;its
      weak hardness, its provoking superficiality. He expressed the traits of
      melancholy and loss that he imagined in him, yet he always was tempted to
      leave the picture with a touch of something sinister in it, some airy and
      subtle shadow of selfish design.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared hard at Don Ippolito while this perplexity filled his mind, for
      the hundredth time; then he said stiffly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t want to
      marry anybody. Besides,&rdquo; he added, relaxing into a smile of helpless
      amusement, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s possible that Miss Vervain might not want to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; replied Don Ippolito, &ldquo;you never can tell. All young girls
      desire to be married, I suppose,&rdquo; he continued with a sigh. &ldquo;She is very
      beautiful, is she not? It is seldom that we see such a blonde in Italy.
      Our blondes are dark; they have auburn hair and blue eyes, but their
      complexions are thick. Miss Vervain is blonde as the morning light; the
      sun&rsquo;s gold is in her hair, his noonday whiteness in her dazzling throat;
      the flush of his coming is on her lips; she might utter the dawn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a poet, Don Ippolito,&rdquo; laughed the painter. &ldquo;What property of the
      sun is in her angry-looking eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His fire! Ah, that is her greatest charm! Those strange eyes of hers,
      they seem full of tragedies. She looks made to be the heroine of some
      stormy romance; and yet how simply patient and good she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ferris, who often responded in English to the priest&rsquo;s
      Italian; and he added half musingly in his own tongue, after a moment,
      &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it would be safe to count upon her. I&rsquo;m afraid she has
      a bad temper. At any rate, I always expect to see smoke somewhere when I
      look at those eyes of hers. She has wonderful self-control, however; and I
      don&rsquo;t exactly understand why. Perhaps people of strong impulses have
      strong wills to overrule them; it seems no more than fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the custom,&rdquo; asked Don Ippolito, after a moment, &ldquo;for the American
      young ladies always to address their mammas as <i>mother</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that seems to be a peculiarity of Miss Vervain&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a little
      formality that I should say served to hold Mrs. Vervain in check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that it repulses her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I don&rsquo;t think I could explain,&rdquo; said Ferris with a certain
      air of regretting to have gone so far in comment on the Vervains. He added
      recklessly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that Mrs. Vervain sometimes does and says
      things that embarrass her daughter, and that Miss Vervain seems to try to
      restrain her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; returned Don Ippolito meditatively, &ldquo;that the signorina was
      always very tenderly submissive to her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so she is,&rdquo; said the painter dryly, and looked in annoyance from the
      priest to the picture, and from the picture to the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute Don Ippolito said, &ldquo;They must be very rich to live as they
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Ferris. &ldquo;Americans spend and save in
      ways different from the Italians. I dare say the Vervains find Venice very
      cheap after London and Paris and Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, &ldquo;if they were rich you would be in a
      position to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not marry Miss Vervain for her money,&rdquo; answered the painter,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but if you loved her, the money would enable you to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Don Ippolito. I never said that I loved Miss Vervain, and I
      don&rsquo;t know how you feel warranted in speaking to me about the matter. Why
      do you do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why? I could not but imagine that you must love her. Is there anything
      wrong in speaking of such things? Is it contrary to the American custom? I
      ask pardon from my heart if I have done anything amiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no offense,&rdquo; said the painter, with a laugh, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t wonder
      you thought I ought to be in love with Miss Vervain. She <i>is</i>
      beautiful, and I believe she&rsquo;s good. But if men had to marry because women
      were beautiful and good, there isn&rsquo;t one of us could live single a day.
      Besides, I&rsquo;m the victim of another passion,&mdash;I&rsquo;m laboring under an
      unrequited affection for Art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do <i>not</i> love her?&rdquo; asked Don Ippolito, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m advised at present, no, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo; said the priest, absently, but with a glowing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quitted the painter&rsquo;s and walked swiftly homeward with a triumphant
      buoyancy of step. A subtle content diffused itself over his face, and a
      joyful light burnt in his deep eyes. He sat down before the piano and
      organ as he had arranged them, and began to strike their keys in unison;
      this seemed to him for the first time childish. Then he played some lively
      bars on the piano alone; they sounded too light and trivial, and he turned
      to the other instrument. As the plaint of the reeds arose, it filled his
      sense like a solemn organ-music, and transfigured the place; the notes
      swelled to the ample vault of a church, and at the high altar he was
      celebrating the mass in his sacerdotal robes. He suddenly caught his
      fingers away from the keys; his breast heaved, he hid his face in his
      hands.

      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ferris stood cleaning his palette, after Don Ippolito was gone, scraping
      the colors together with his knife and neatly buttering them on the
      palette&rsquo;s edge, while he wondered what the priest meant by pumping him in
      that way. Nothing, he supposed, and yet it was odd. Of course she had a
      bad temper....
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on his hat and coat and strolled vaguely forth, and in an hour or
      two came by a roundabout course to the gondola station nearest his own
      house. There he stopped, and after an absent contemplation of the boats,
      from which the gondoliers were clamoring for his custom, he stepped into
      one and ordered the man to row him to a gate on a small canal opposite.
      The gate opened, at his ringing, into the garden of the Vervains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida was sitting alone on a bench near the fountain. It was no longer a
      ruined fountain; the broken-nosed naiad held a pipe above her head, and
      from this rose a willowy spray high enough to catch some colors of the
      sunset then striking into the garden, and fell again in a mist around her,
      making her almost modest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; asked Ferris, carelessly taking the young girl&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;I thought this lady&rsquo;s occupation was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito repaired the fountain for the landlord, and he agreed to pay
      for filling the tank that feeds it,&rdquo; said Florida. &ldquo;He seems to think it a
      hard bargain, for he only lets it play about half an hour a day. But he
      says it&rsquo;s very ingeniously mended. He didn&rsquo;t believe it could be done. It
      <i>is</i> pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; said the painter, with a singular desire, going through
      him like a pang, likewise to do something for Miss Vervain. &ldquo;Did you go to
      Don Ippolito&rsquo;s house the other day, to see his traps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we were very much interested. I was sorry that I knew so little
      about inventions. Do you think there are many practical ideas amongst his
      things? I hope there are&mdash;he seemed so proud and pleased to show
      them. Shouldn&rsquo;t you think he had some real inventive talent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he has; but I know as little about the matter as you do.&rdquo; He
      sat down beside her, and picking up a twig from the gravel, pulled the
      bark off in silence. Then, &ldquo;Miss Vervain,&rdquo; he said, knitting his brows, as
      he always did when he had something on his conscience and meant to ease it
      at any cost, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the dog that fetches a bone and carries a bone; I talked
      Don Ippolito over with you, the other day, and now I&rsquo;ve been talking you
      over with him. But I&rsquo;ve the grace to say that I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why need you be ashamed?&rdquo; asked Florida. &ldquo;You said no harm of him. Did
      you of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly; but I don&rsquo;t think it was quite my business to discuss you at
      all. I think you can&rsquo;t let people alone too much. For my part, if I try to
      characterize my friends, I fail to do them perfect justice, of course; and
      yet the imperfect result remains representative of them in my mind; it
      limits them and fixes them; and I can&rsquo;t get them back again into the
      undefined and the ideal where they really belong. One ought never to speak
      of the faults of one&rsquo;s friends: it mutilates them; they can never be the
      same afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have been talking of my faults,&rdquo; said Florida, breathing quickly.
      &ldquo;Perhaps you could tell me of them to my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have to say that unfairness was one of them. But that is common
      to the whole sex. I never said I was talking of your faults. I declared
      against doing so, and you immediately infer that my motive is remorse. I
      don&rsquo;t know that you have any faults. They may be virtues in disguise.
      There is a charm even in unfairness. Well, I did say that I thought you
      had a quick temper,&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida colored violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;but now I see that I was mistaken,&rdquo; said Ferris with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what else you said?&rdquo; demanded the young girl haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be a betrayal of confidence,&rdquo; said Ferris, unaffected by
      her hauteur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you mentioned the matter to me at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to clear my conscience, I suppose, and sin again. I wanted to
      talk with you about Don Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida looked with perplexity at Ferris&rsquo;s face, while her own slowly
      cooled and paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want to say of him?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know how to put it: that he puzzles me, to begin with. You know
      I feel somewhat responsible for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I never should have thought of him, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for your
      mother&rsquo;s talk that morning coming back from San Lazzaro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Florida, with a faint blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, don&rsquo;t you see, it was as much a fancy of mine, a weakness for
      the man himself, as the desire to serve your mother, that prompted me to
      bring him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; answered the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acted in the teeth of a bitter Venetian prejudice against priests. All
      my friends here&mdash;they&rsquo;re mostly young men with the modern Italian
      ideas, or old liberals&mdash;hate and despise the priests. They believe
      that priests are full of guile and deceit, that they are spies for the
      Austrians, and altogether evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito is welcome to report our most secret thoughts to the
      police,&rdquo; said Florida, whose look of rising alarm relaxed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the painter, &ldquo;how you leap to conclusions! I never intimated
      that Don Ippolito was a spy. On the contrary, it was his difference from
      other priests that made me think of him for a moment. He seems to be as
      much cut off from the church as from the world. And yet he is a priest,
      with a priest&rsquo;s education. What if I should have been altogether mistaken?
      He is either one of the openest souls in the world, as you have insisted,
      or he is one of the closest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be afraid of him in any case,&rdquo; said Florida; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
      believe any wrong of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris frowned in annoyance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to; I don&rsquo;t, myself. I&rsquo;ve
      bungled the matter as I might have known I would. I was trying to put into
      words an undefined uneasiness of mine, a quite formless desire to have you
      possessed of the whole case as it had come up in my mind. I&rsquo;ve made a mess
      of it,&rdquo; said Ferris rising, with a rueful air. &ldquo;Besides, I ought to have
      spoken to Mrs. Vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; cried Florida, eagerly, springing to her feet beside him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
      Little things wear upon my mother, so. I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t speak to her. I
      don&rsquo;t misunderstand you, I think; I expressed myself badly,&rdquo; she added
      with an anxious face. &ldquo;I thank you very much. What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By Ferris&rsquo;s impulse they both began to move down the garden path toward
      the water-gate. The sunset had faded out of the fountain, but it still lit
      the whole heaven, in whose vast blue depths hung light whiffs of pinkish
      cloud, as ethereal as the draperies that floated after Miss Vervain as she
      walked with a splendid grace beside him, no awkwardness, now, or
      self-constraint in her. As she turned to Ferris, and asked in her deep
      tones, to which some latent feeling imparted a slight tremor, &ldquo;What do you
      want me to do?&rdquo; the sense of her willingness to be bidden by him gave him
      a delicious thrill. He looked at the superb creature, so proud, so
      helpless; so much a woman, so much a child; and he caught his breath
      before he answered. Her gauzes blew about his feet in the light breeze
      that lifted the foliage; she was a little near-sighted, and in her
      eagerness she drew closer to him, fixing her eyes full upon his with a
      bold innocence. &ldquo;Good heavens! Miss Vervain,&rdquo; he cried, with a sudden
      blush, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a serious matter. I&rsquo;m a fool to have spoken to you. Don&rsquo;t
      do anything. Let things go on as before. It isn&rsquo;t for me to instruct you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been very glad of your advice,&rdquo; she said with a
      disappointed, almost wounded manner, keeping her eyes upon him. &ldquo;It seems
      to me we are always going wrong&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, with a flush and then a pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris returned her look with one of comical dismay. This apparent
      readiness of Miss Vervain&rsquo;s to be taken command of, daunted him, on second
      thoughts. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d dismiss all my stupid talk from your mind,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;d been guiltily trying to set you against a man whom
      I like very much and have no reason not to trust, and who thinks me so
      much his friend that he couldn&rsquo;t dream of my making any sort of trouble
      for him. It would break his heart, I&rsquo;m afraid, if you treated him in a
      different way from that in which you&rsquo;ve treated him till now. It&rsquo;s really
      touching to listen to his gratitude to you and your mother. It&rsquo;s only
      conceivable on the ground that he has never had friends before in the
      world. He seems like another man, or the same man come to life. And it
      isn&rsquo;t his fault that he&rsquo;s a priest. I suppose,&rdquo; he added, with a sort of
      final throe, &ldquo;that a Venetian family wouldn&rsquo;t use him with the frank
      hospitality you&rsquo;ve shown, not because they distrusted him at all, perhaps,
      but because they would be afraid of other Venetian tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ultimate drop of venom, helplessly distilled, did not seem to rankle
      in Miss Vervain&rsquo;s mind. She walked now with her face turned from his, and
      she answered coldly, &ldquo;We shall not be troubled. We don&rsquo;t care for Venetian
      tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the gate. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Ferris, abruptly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you wait and see my mother?&rdquo; asked Florida, with her awkward
      self-constraint again upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Ferris, gloomily. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time. I just dropped in
      for a moment, to blast an innocent man&rsquo;s reputation, and destroy a young
      lady&rsquo;s peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you needn&rsquo;t go, yet,&rdquo; answered Florida, coldly, &ldquo;for you haven&rsquo;t
      succeeded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done my worst,&rdquo; returned Ferris, drawing the bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, hanging his head in amazement and disgust at himself for his
      clumsiness and bad taste. It seemed to him a contemptible part, first to
      embarrass them with Don Ippolito&rsquo;s acquaintance, if it was an
      embarrassment, and then try to sneak out of his responsibility by these
      tardy cautions; and if it was not going to be an embarrassment, it was
      folly to have approached the matter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he wanted to do, and with what motive? He hardly knew. As he
      battled the ground over and over again, nothing comforted him save the
      thought that, bad as it was to have spoken to Miss Vervain, it must have
      been infinitely worse to speak to her mother.

    <h2>
      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late before Ferris forgot his chagrin in sleep, and when he woke
      the next morning, the sun was making the solid green blinds at his window
      odorous of their native pine woods with its heat, and thrusting a golden
      spear at the heart of Don Ippolito&rsquo;s effigy where he had left it on the
      easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marina brought a letter with his coffee. The letter was from Mrs. Vervain,
      and it entreated him to come to lunch at twelve, and then join them on an
      excursion, of which they had all often talked, up the Canal of the Brenta.
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito has got his permission&mdash;think of his not being able to
      go to the mainland without the Patriarch&rsquo;s leave! and can go with us
      to-day. So I try to make this hasty arrangement. You <i>must</i> come&mdash;it
      all depends upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so it seems,&rdquo; groaned the painter, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the garden he found Don Ippolito and Florida, at the fountain where he
      had himself parted with her the evening before; and he observed with a
      guilty relief that Don Ippolito was talking to her in the happy
      unconsciousness habitual with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida cast at the painter a swift glance of latent appeal and
      intelligence, which he refused, and in the same instant she met him with
      another look, as if she now saw him for the first time, and gave him her
      hand in greeting. It was a beautiful hand; he could not help worshipping
      its lovely forms, and the lily whiteness and softness of the back, the
      rose of the palm and finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She idly resumed the great Venetian fan which hung from her waist by a
      chain. &ldquo;Don Ippolito has been talking about the villeggiatura on the
      Brenta in the old days,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the painter, &ldquo;they used to have merry times in the villas
      then, and it was worth while being a priest, or at least an abbate di
      casa. I should think you would sigh for a return of those good old days,
      Don Ippolito. Just imagine, if you were abbate di casa with some patrician
      family about the close of the last century, you might be the instructor,
      companion, and spiritual adviser of Illustrissima at the theatres,
      card-parties, and masquerades, all winter; and at this season, instead of
      going up the Brenta for a day&rsquo;s pleasure with us barbarous Yankees, you
      might be setting out with Illustrissima and all the &lsquo;Strissimi and
      &lsquo;Strissime, big and little, for a spring villeggiatura there. You would be
      going in a gilded barge, with songs and fiddles and dancing, instead of a
      common gondola, and you would stay a month, walking, going to parties and
      caffès, drinking chocolate and lemonade, gaming, sonneteering, and
      butterflying about generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was doubtless a beautiful life,&rdquo; answered the priest, with simple
      indifference. &ldquo;But I never have thought of it with regret, because I have
      been preoccupied with other ideas than those of social pleasures, though
      perhaps they were no wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida had watched Don Ippolito&rsquo;s face while Ferris was speaking, and she
      now asked gravely, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think their life nowadays is more
      becoming to the clergy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madamigella? What harm was there in those gayeties? I suppose the
      bad features of the old life are exaggerated to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have been worse than the amusements of the hard-drinking,
      hard-riding, hard-swearing, fox-hunting English parsons about the same
      time,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;Besides, the abbate di casa had a charm of his own,
      the charm of all <i>rococo</i> things, which, whatever you may say of
      them, are somehow elegant and refined, or at least refer to elegance and
      refinement. I don&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re ennobling, but they&rsquo;re fascinating. I
      don&rsquo;t respect them, but I love them. When I think about the past of
      Venice, I don&rsquo;t care so much to see any of the heroically historical
      things; but I should like immensely to have looked in at the Ridotto, when
      the place was at its gayest with wigs and masks, hoops and small-clothes,
      fans and rapiers, bows and courtesies, whispers and glances. I dare say I
      should have found Don Ippolito there in some becoming disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida looked from the painter to the priest and back to the painter, as
      Ferris spoke, and then she turned a little anxiously toward the terrace,
      and a shadow slipped from her face as her mother came rustling down the
      steps, catching at her drapery and shaking it into place. The young girl
      hurried to meet her, lifted her arms for what promised an embrace, and
      with firm hands set the elder lady&rsquo;s bonnet straight with her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always getting it on askew,&rdquo; Mrs. Vervain said for greeting to
      Ferris. &ldquo;How do you do, Don Ippolito? But I suppose you think I&rsquo;ve kept
      you long enough to get it on straight for once. So I have. I <i>am</i> a
      fuss, and I don&rsquo;t deny it. At my time of life, it&rsquo;s much harder to make
      yourself shipshape than it is when you&rsquo;re younger. I tell Florida that
      anybody would take <i>her</i> for the <i>old</i> lady, she does seem to
      give so little care to getting up an appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet she has the effect of a stylish young person in the bloom of
      youth,&rdquo; observed Ferris, with a touch of caricature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better lunch with our things on,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;and then
      there needn&rsquo;t be any delay in starting. I thought we would have it here,&rdquo;
       she added, as Nina and the house-servant appeared with trays of dishes and
      cups. &ldquo;So that we can start in a real picnicky spirit. I knew you&rsquo;d think
      it a womanish lunch, Mr. Ferris&mdash;Don Ippolito likes what we do&mdash;and
      so I&rsquo;ve provided you with a chicken salad; and I&rsquo;m going to ask you for a
      taste of it; I&rsquo;m really hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was salad for all, in fact; and it was quite one o&rsquo;clock before the
      lunch was ended, and wraps of just the right thickness and thinness were
      chosen, and the party were comfortably placed under the striped linen
      canopy of the gondola, which they had from a public station, the
      house-gondola being engaged that day. They rowed through the narrow canal
      skirting the garden out into the expanse before the Giudecca, and then
      struck across the lagoon towards Fusina, past the island-church of San
      Giorgio in Alga, whose beautiful tower has flushed and darkened in so many
      pictures of Venetian sunsets, and past the Austrian lagoon forts with
      their coronets of guns threatening every point, and the Croatian sentinels
      pacing to and fro on their walls. They stopped long enough at one of the
      customs barges to declare to the swarthy, amiable officers the innocence
      of their freight, and at the mouth of the Canal of the Brenta they paused
      before the station while a policeman came out and scanned them. He bowed
      to Don Ippolito&rsquo;s cloth, and then they began to push up the sluggish
      canal, shallow and overrun with weeds and mosses, into the heart of the
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring, which in Venice comes in the softening air and the perpetual
      azure of the heavens, was renewed to their senses in all its miraculous
      loveliness. The garden of the Vervains had indeed confessed it in opulence
      of leaf and bloom, but there it seemed somehow only like a novel effect of
      the artifice which had been able to create a garden in that city of stone
      and sea. Here a vernal world suddenly opened before them, with
      wide-stretching fields of green under a dome of perfect blue; against its
      walls only the soft curves of far-off hills were traced, and near at hand
      the tender forms of full-foliaged trees. The long garland of vines that
      festoons all Italy seemed to begin in the neighboring orchards; the
      meadows waved their tall grasses in the sun, and broke in poppies as the
      sea-waves break in iridescent spray; the well-grown maize shook its
      gleaming blades in the light; the poplars marched in stately procession on
      either side of the straight, white road to Padua, till they vanished in
      the long perspective. The blossoms had fallen from the trees many weeks
      before, but the air was full of the vague sweetness of the perfect spring,
      which here and there gathered and defined itself as the spicy odor of the
      grass cut on the shore of the canal, and drying in the mellow heat of the
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyagers spoke from time to time of some peculiarity of the villas
      that succeeded each other along the canal. Don Ippolito knew a few of
      them, the gondoliers knew others; but after all, their names were nothing.
      These haunts of old-time splendor and idleness weary of themselves, and
      unable to escape, are sadder than anything in Venice, and they belonged,
      as far as the Americans were concerned, to a world as strange as any to
      which they should go in another life,&mdash;the world of a faded fashion
      and an alien history. Some of the villas were kept in a sort of repair;
      some were even maintained in the state of old; but the most showed marks
      of greater or less decay, and here and there one was falling to ruin. They
      had gardens about them, tangled and wild-grown; a population of decrepit
      statues in the rococo taste strolled in their walks or simpered from their
      gates. Two or three houses seemed to be occupied; the rest stood empty,
      each
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Close latticed to the brooding heat,
  And silent in its dusty vines.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The pleasure-party had no fixed plan for the day further than to ascend
      the canal, and by and by take a carriage at some convenient village and
      drive to the famous Villa Pisani at Strà.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These houses are very well,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, who had visited the villa
      once, and with whom it had remained a memory almost as signal as that
      night in Padua when he wore civil dress, &ldquo;but it is at Strà you see
      something really worthy of the royal splendor of the patricians of Venice.
      Royal? The villa is now one of the palaces of the ex-Emperor of Austria,
      who does not find it less imperial than his other palaces.&rdquo; Don Ippolito
      had celebrated the villa at Strà in this strain ever since they had spoken
      of going up the Brenta: now it was the magnificent conservatories and
      orangeries that he sang, now the vast garden with its statued walks
      between rows of clipt cedars and firs, now the stables with their stalls
      for numberless horses, now the palace itself with its frescoed halls and
      treasures of art and vertu. His enthusiasm for the villa at Strà had
      become an amiable jest with the Americans. Ferris laughed at his fresh
      outburst he declared himself tired of the gondola, and he asked Florida to
      disembark with him and walk under the trees of a pleasant street running
      on one side between the villas and the canal. &ldquo;We are going to find
      something much grander than the Villa Pisani,&rdquo; he boasted, with a look at
      Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sauntered along the path together, they came now and then to a
      stately palace like that of the Contarini, where the lions, that give
      their name to one branch of the family, crouch in stone before the grand
      portal; but most of the houses were interesting only from their unstoried
      possibilities to the imagination. They were generally of stucco, and
      glared with fresh whitewash through the foliage of their gardens. When a
      peasant&rsquo;s cottage broke their line, it gave, with its barns and
      straw-stacks and its beds of pot-herbs, a homely relief from the decaying
      gentility of the villas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity, Miss Vervain,&rdquo; said the painter, &ldquo;that the blessings of this
      world should be so unequally divided! Why should all this sketchable
      adversity be lavished upon the neighborhood of a city that is so rich as
      Venice in picturesque dilapidation? It&rsquo;s pretty hard on us Americans, and
      forces people of sensibility into exile. What wouldn&rsquo;t cultivated persons
      give for a stretch of this street in the suburbs of Boston, or of your own
      Providence? I suppose the New Yorkers will be setting up something of the
      kind one of these days, and giving it a French name&mdash;they&rsquo;ll call it
      <i>Aux bords du Brenta</i>. There was one of them carried back a gondola
      the other day to put on a pond in their new park. But the worst of it is,
      you can&rsquo;t take home the sentiment of these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was the business of painters to send home the sentiment of
      them in pictures,&rdquo; said Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris talked to her in this way because it was his way of talking; it
      always surprised him a little that she entered into the spirit of it; he
      was not quite sure that she did; he sometimes thought she waited till she
      could seize upon a point to turn against him, and so give herself the air
      of having comprehended the whole. He laughed: &ldquo;Oh yes, a poor little
      fragmentary, faded-out reproduction of their sentiment&mdash;which is &lsquo;as
      moonlight unto sunlight and as water unto wine,&rsquo; when compared with the
      real thing. Suppose I made a picture of this very bit, ourselves in the
      foreground, looking at the garden over there where that amusing Vandal of
      an owner has just had his statues painted white: would our friends at home
      understand it? A whole history must be left unexpressed. I could only hint
      at an entire situation. Of course, people with a taste for olives would
      get the flavor; but even they would wonder that I chose such an
      unsuggestive bit. Why, it is just the most maddeningly suggestive thing to
      be found here! And if I may put it modestly, for my share in it, I think
      we two young Americans looking on at this supreme excess of the rococo,
      are the very essence of the sentiment of the scene; but what would the
      honored connoisseurs&mdash;the good folks who get themselves up on Ruskin
      and try so honestly hard to have some little ideas about art&mdash;make of
      us? To be sure they might justifiably praise the grace of your pose, if I
      were so lucky as to catch it, and your way of putting your hand under the
      elbow of the arm that holds your parasol,&rdquo;&mdash;Florida seemed
      disdainfully to keep her attitude, and the painter smiled,&mdash;&ldquo;but they
      wouldn&rsquo;t know what it all meant, and couldn&rsquo;t imagine that we were
      inspired by this rascally little villa to sigh longingly over the wicked
      past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Florida, with a touch of trouble in her proud
      manner, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sighing over it, for one, and I don&rsquo;t want it back. I&rsquo;m
      glad that I&rsquo;m American and that there is no past for me. I can&rsquo;t
      understand how you and Don Ippolito can speak so tolerantly of what no one
      can respect,&rdquo; she added, in almost an aggrieved tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Miss Vervain wanted to turn the talk upon Don Ippolito, Ferris by no
      means did; he had had enough of that subject yesterday; he got as lightly
      away from it as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Don Ippolito&rsquo;s a pagan, I tell you; and I&rsquo;m a painter, and the rococo
      is my weakness. I wish I could paint it, but I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m a hundred years
      too late. I couldn&rsquo;t even paint myself in the act of sentimentalizing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he talked, he had been making a few lines in a small pocket
      sketch-book, with a furtive glance or two at Florida. When they returned
      to the boat, he busied himself again with the book, and presently he
      handed it to Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Florida!&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;How very nicely you do sketch, Mr.
      Ferris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Mrs. Vervain; you&rsquo;re always flattering me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but seriously. I <i>wish</i> that I had paid more attention to my
      drawing when I was a girl. And now, Florida&mdash;she won&rsquo;t touch a
      pencil. I wish you&rsquo;d talk to her, Mr. Ferris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, people who are pictures needn&rsquo;t trouble themselves to be painters,&rdquo;
       said Ferris, with a little burlesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain began to look at the sketch through her tubed hand; the
      painter made a grimace. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve made her too proud, Mr. Ferris. She
      doesn&rsquo;t look like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes she does&mdash;to those unworthy of her kindness. I have taken Miss
      Vervain in the act of scorning the rococo, and its humble admirer, me,
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr. Ferris; but I can&rsquo;t think
      that this proud look is habitual with Florida; and I&rsquo;ve heard people say&mdash;very
      good judges&mdash;that an artist oughtn&rsquo;t to perpetuate a temporary
      expression. Something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped now, Mrs. Vervain: the sketch is irretrievably
      immortal. I&rsquo;m sorry, but it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stuff! As if you couldn&rsquo;t turn up the corners of the mouth a little.
      Or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give her the appearance of laughing at me? Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, turning to the priest, who had been
      listening intently to all this trivial talk, &ldquo;what do you think of this
      sketch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the book with an eager hand, and perused the sketch as if trying
      to read some secret there. After a minute he handed it back with a light
      sigh, apparently of relief, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I ask pardon. No, it isn&rsquo;t my idea of madamigella. It seems to me
      that her likeness must be sketched in color. Those lines are true, but
      they need color to subdue them; they go too far, they are more than true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Don Ippolito,&rdquo; said Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t think she always has this proud look?&rdquo; pursued Mrs.
      Vervain. The painter fancied that Florida quelled in herself a movement of
      impatience; he looked at her with an amused smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, no,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes her face expresses the greatest meekness in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not at the present moment,&rdquo; thought Ferris, fascinated by the stare
      of angry pride which the girl bent upon the unconscious priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I confess that I should hardly know how to characterize her
      habitual expression,&rdquo; added Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Florida, peremptorily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of the subject; it isn&rsquo;t
      an important one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes it is, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s important to
      me, if it isn&rsquo;t to you; for I&rsquo;m your mother, and really, if I thought you
      looked like this, as a general thing, to a casual observer, I should
      consider it a reflection upon myself.&rdquo; Ferris gave a provoking laugh, as
      she continued sweetly, &ldquo;I must insist, Don Ippolito: now did you ever see
      Florida look so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned back, and began to wave her fan slowly to and fro before
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw her look so with you, dear madama,&rdquo; said the priest with an
      anxious glance at Florida, who let her fan fall folded into her lap, and
      sat still. He went on with priestly smoothness, and a touch of something
      like invoked authority, such as a man might show who could dispense
      indulgences and inflict penances. &ldquo;No one could help seeing her
      devotedness to you, and I have admired from the first an obedience and
      tenderness that I have never known equaled. In all her relations to you,
      madamigella has seemed to me&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida started forward. &ldquo;You are not asked to comment on my behavior to
      my mother; you are not invited to speak of my conduct at all!&rdquo; she burst
      out with sudden violence, her visage flaming, and her blue eyes burning
      upon Don Ippolito, who shrank from the astonishing rudeness as from a blow
      in the face. &ldquo;What is it to you how I treat my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank back again upon the cushions, and opening the fan with a clash
      swept it swiftly before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florida!&rdquo; said her mother gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris turned away in cold disgust, like one who has witnessed a cruelty
      done to some helpless thing. Don Ippolito&rsquo;s speech was not fortunate at
      the best, but it might have come from a foreigner&rsquo;s misapprehension, and
      at the worst it was good-natured and well-meant. &ldquo;The girl is a perfect
      brute, as I thought in the beginning,&rdquo; the painter said to himself. &ldquo;How
      could I have ever thought differently? I shall have to tell Don Ippolito
      that I&rsquo;m ashamed of her, and disclaim all responsibility. Pah! I wish I
      was out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pleasure of the day was dead. It could not rally from that stroke.
      They went on to Strà, as they had planned, but the glory of the Villa
      Pisani was eclipsed for Don Ippolito. He plainly did not know what to do.
      He did not address Florida again, whose savagery he would not probably
      have known how to resent if he had wished to resent it. Mrs. Vervain
      prattled away to him with unrelenting kindness; Ferris kept near him, and
      with affectionate zeal tried to make him talk of the villa, but neither
      the frescoes, nor the orangeries, nor the green-houses, nor the stables,
      nor the gardens could rouse him from the listless daze in which he moved,
      though Ferris found them all as wonderful as he had said. Amidst this
      heavy embarrassment no one seemed at ease but the author of it. She did
      not, to be sure, speak to Don Ippolito, but she followed her mother as
      usual with her assiduous cares, and she appeared tranquilly unconscious of
      the sarcastic civility with which Ferris rendered her any service. It was
      late in the afternoon when they got back to their boat and began to
      descend the canal towards Venice, and long before they reached Fusina the
      day had passed. A sunset of melancholy red, streaked with level lines of
      murky cloud, stretched across the flats behind them, and faintly tinged
      with its reflected light the eastern horizon which the towers and domes of
      Venice had not yet begun to break. The twilight came, and then through the
      overcast heavens the moon shone dim; a light blossomed here and there in
      the villas, distant voices called musically; a cow lowed, a dog barked;
      the rich, sweet breath of the vernal land mingled its odors with the
      sultry air of the neighboring lagoon. The wayfarers spoke little; the time
      hung heavy on all, no doubt; to Ferris it was a burden almost intolerable
      to hear the creak of the oars and the breathing of the gondoliers keeping
      time together. At last the boat stopped in front of the police-station in
      Fusina; a soldier with a sword at his side and a lantern in his hand came
      out and briefly parleyed with the gondoliers; they stepped ashore, and he
      marched them into the station before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have nothing left to wish for now,&rdquo; said Ferris, breaking into an
      ironical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better go see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go with you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pazienza!&rdquo; replied Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies rose; but Don Ippolito remained seated. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going too,
      Don Ippolito?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, madama; but I prefer to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lamentable cries and shrieks, as if the prisoners had immediately been put
      to the torture, came from the station as Ferris opened the door. A lamp of
      petroleum lighted the scene, and shone upon the figures of two fishermen,
      who bewailed themselves unintelligibly in the vibrant accents of Chiozza,
      and from time to time advanced upon the gondoliers, and shook their heads
      and beat their breasts at them, A few police-guards reclined upon benches
      about the room, and surveyed the spectacle with mild impassibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris politely asked one of them the cause of the detention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, signore,&rdquo; answered the guard amiably, &ldquo;these honest men
      accuse your gondoliers of having stolen a rope out of their boat at Dolo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my blood, you know!&rdquo; howled the elder of the fishermen, tossing
      his arms wildly abroad, &ldquo;it was my own heart,&rdquo; he cried, letting the last
      vowel die away and rise again in mournful refrain, while he stared
      tragically into Ferris&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain, putting up her glasses,
      and trying with graceful futility to focus the melodrama.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ferris; &ldquo;our gondoliers have had the heart&rsquo;s blood of this
      respectable Dervish; that is to say, they have stolen a rope belonging to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Our</i> gondoliers! I don&rsquo;t believe it. They&rsquo;ve no right to keep us
      here all night. Tell them you&rsquo;re the American consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not try my dignity on these underlings, Mrs. Vervain; there&rsquo;s
      no American squadron here that I could order to bombard Fusina, if they
      didn&rsquo;t mind me. But I&rsquo;ll see what I can do further in quality of courteous
      foreigner. Can you perhaps tell me how long you will be obliged to detain
      us here?&rdquo; he asked of the guard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to detain you at all, signore. But what can I do? The
      commissary is unhappily absent. He may be here soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard renewed his apathetic contemplation of the gondoliers, who did
      not speak a word; the windy lamentation of the fishermen rose and fell
      fitfully. Presently they went out of doors and poured forth their wrongs
      to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was close, and with some trouble Ferris persuaded Mrs. Vervain to
      return to the gondola, Florida seconding his arguments with gentle good
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a long time till the commissary came, but his coming instantly
      simplified the situation. Perhaps because he had never been able to
      befriend a consul in trouble before, he befriended Ferris to the utmost.
      He had met him with rather a browbeating air; but after a glance at his
      card, he gave a kind of roar of deprecation and apology. He had the ladies
      and Don Ippolito in out of the gondola, and led them to an upper chamber,
      where he made them all repose their honored persons upon his sofas. He
      ordered up his housekeeper to make them coffee, which he served with his
      own hands, excusing its hurried feebleness, and he stood by, rubbing his
      palms together and smiling, while they refreshed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They need never tell me again that the Austrians are tyrants,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Vervain in undertone to the consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy for Ferris to remind his host of the malefactors; but he
      brought himself to this ungraciousness. The commissary begged pardon, and
      asked him to accompany him below, where he confronted the accused and the
      accusers. The tragedy was acted over again with blood-curdling
      effectiveness by the Chiozzotti; the gondoliers maintaining the calm of
      conscious innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris felt outraged by the trumped-up charge against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, you others the prisoners,&rdquo; said the commissary. &ldquo;Your padrone is
      anxious to return to Venice, and I wish to inflict no further displeasures
      upon him. Restore their rope to these honest men, and go about your
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The injured gondoliers spoke in low tones together; then one of them
      shrugged his shoulders and went out. He came back in a moment and laid a
      rope before the commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the rope?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We found it floating down the canal, and
      picked it up that we might give it to the rightful owner. But now I wish
      to heaven we had let it sink to the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a beautiful story!&rdquo; wailed the Chiozzoti. They flung themselves upon
      the rope, and lugged it off to their boat; and the gondoliers went out,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissary turned to Ferris with an amiable smile. &ldquo;I am sorry that
      those rogues should escape,&rdquo; said the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Italian, &ldquo;they are poor fellows it is a little matter; I am
      glad to have served you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took leave of his involuntary guests with effusion, following them with
      a lantern to the gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain, to whom Ferris gave an account of this trial as they set out
      again on their long-hindered return, had no mind save for the magical
      effect of his consular quality upon the commissary, and accused him of a
      vain and culpable modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the diplomatist, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like knowing just when to
      produce your dignity. There are some officials who know too little,&mdash;like
      those guards; and there are some who know too much,&mdash;like the
      commissary&rsquo;s superiors. But he is just in that golden mean of ignorance
      where he supposes a consul is a person of importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain disputed this, and Ferris submitted in silence. Presently, as
      they skirted the shore to get their bearings for the route across the
      lagoon, a fierce voice in Venetian shouted from the darkness, &ldquo;Indrio,
      indrio!&rdquo; (Back, back!) and a gleam of the moon through the pale, watery
      clouds revealed the figure of a gendarme on the nearest point of land. The
      gondoliers bent to their oars, and sent the boat swiftly out into the
      lagoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, for example, is a person who would be quite insensible to my
      greatness, even if I had the consular seal in my pocket. To him we are
      possible smugglers; [Footnote: Under the Austrians, Venice was a free port
      but everything carried there to the mainland was liable to duty.] and I
      must say,&rdquo; he continued, taking out his watch, and staring hard at it,
      &ldquo;that if I were a disinterested person, and heard his suspicion met with
      the explanation that we were a little party out here for pleasure at half
      past twelve P. M., I should say he was right. At any rate we won&rsquo;t engage
      him in controversy. Quick, quick!&rdquo; he added to the gondoliers, glancing at
      the receding shore, and then at the first of the lagoon forts which they
      were approaching. A dim shape moved along the top of the wall, and seemed
      to linger and scrutinize them. As they drew nearer, the challenge, &ldquo;<i>Wer
      da?</i>&rdquo; rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondoliers eagerly answered with the one word of German known to their
      craft, &ldquo;<i>Freunde</i>,&rdquo; and struggled to urge the boat forward; the oar
      of the gondolier in front slipped from the high rowlock, and fell out of
      his hand into the water. The gondola lurched, and then suddenly ran
      aground on the shallow. The sentry halted, dropped his gun from his
      shoulder, and ordered them to go on, while the gondoliers clamored back in
      the high key of fear, and one of them screamed out to his passengers to do
      something, saying that, a few weeks before, a sentinel had fired upon a
      fisherman and killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s talking about?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get
      on, it will be that man&rsquo;s duty to fire on us; he has no choice,&rdquo; she said,
      nerved and interested by the presence of this danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondoliers leaped into the water and tried to push the boat off. It
      would not move, and without warning, Don Ippolito, who had sat silent
      since they left Fusina, stepped over the side of the gondola, and
      thrusting an oar under its bottom lifted it free of the shallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how very unnecessary!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain, as the priest and the
      gondoliers clambered back into the boat. &ldquo;He will take his death of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;You ought to have told these worthless
      rascals what to do, Don Ippolito. You&rsquo;ve got yourself wet for nothing.
      It&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, taking his seat on the little prow
      deck, and quietly dripping where the water would not incommode the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain, gathering some shawls together, &ldquo;make him
      wrap those about him. He&rsquo;ll die, I know he will&mdash;with that reeking
      skirt of his. If you must go into the water, I wish you had worn your
      abbate&rsquo;s dress. How <i>could</i> you, Don Ippolito?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gondoliers set their oars, but before they had given a stroke, they
      were arrested by a sharp &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; from the fort. Another figure had joined
      the sentry, and stood looking at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ferris, &ldquo;<i>now</i> what, I wonder? That&rsquo;s an officer. If I
      had a little German about me, I might state the situation to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt a light touch on his arm. &ldquo;I can speak German,&rdquo; said Florida
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better speak it now,&rdquo; said Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet, and in a steady voice briefly explained the whole
      affair. The figures listened motionless; then the last comer politely
      replied, begging her to be in no uneasiness, made her a shadowy salute,
      and vanished. The sentry resumed his walk, and took no further notice of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; said Ferris, while Mrs. Vervain babbled her satisfaction, &ldquo;I will
      buy a German Ollendorff to-morrow. The language is indispensable to a
      pleasure excursion in the lagoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida made no reply, but devoted herself to restoring her mother to that
      state of defense against the discomforts of the time and place, which the
      common agitation had impaired. She seemed to have no sense of the presence
      of any one else. Don Ippolito did not speak again save to protect himself
      from the anxieties and reproaches of Mrs. Vervain, renewed and reiterated
      at intervals. She drowsed after a while, and whenever she woke she thought
      they had just touched her own landing. By fits it was cloudy and
      moonlight; they began to meet peasants&rsquo; boats going to the Rialto market;
      at last, they entered the Canal of the Zattere, then they slipped into a
      narrow way, and presently stopped at Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s gate; this time she
      had not expected it. Don Ippolito gave her his hand, and entered the
      garden with her, while Ferris lingered behind with Florida, helping her
      put together the wraps strewn about the gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she commanded, as they moved up the garden walk. &ldquo;I want to speak
      with you about Don Ippolito. What shall I do to him for my rudeness? You
      <i>must</i> tell me&mdash;you <i>shall</i>,&rdquo; she said in a fierce whisper,
      gripping the arm which Ferris had given to help her up the landing-stairs.
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;older than I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I was afraid you were going to say wiser. I should think your own
      sense of justice, your own sense of&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decency. Say it, say it!&rdquo; cried the girl passionately; &ldquo;it was indecent,
      indecent&mdash;that was it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;would tell you what to do,&rdquo; concluded the painter dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung away the arm to which she had been clinging, and ran to where
      the priest stood with her mother at the foot of the terrace stairs. &ldquo;Don
      Ippolito,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I want to tell you that I am sorry; I want to ask
      your pardon&mdash;how can you ever forgive me?&mdash;for what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She instinctively stretched her hand towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the priest, with an indescribable long, trembling sigh. He
      caught her hand in his held it tight, and then pressed it for an instant
      against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris made a little start forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s right, Florida,&rdquo; said her mother, as the four stood in the
      pale, estranging moonlight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Don Ippolito can&rsquo;t cherish any
      resentment. If he does, he must come in and wash it out with a glass of
      wine&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good old fashion. I want you to have the wine at any
      rate, Don Ippolito; it&rsquo;ll keep you from taking cold. You really must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, madama; I cannot lose more time, now; I must go home at once.
      Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Vervain could frame a protest, or lay hold of him, he bowed
      and hurried out of the land-gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly absurd for him to get into the water in that way,&rdquo; she
      said, looking mechanically in the direction in which he had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Vervain, it isn&rsquo;t best to be too grateful to people,&rdquo; said
      Ferris, &ldquo;but I think we must allow that if we were in any danger, sticking
      there in the mud, Don Ippolito got us out of it by putting his shoulder to
      the oar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; continued Ferris, &ldquo;I suppose we may say that, under Providence,
      we probably owe our lives to Don Ippolito&rsquo;s self-sacrifice and Miss
      Vervain&rsquo;s knowledge of German. At any rate, it&rsquo;s what I shall always
      maintain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t you think you had better go in?&rdquo; asked Florida, gently. Her
      gentleness ignored the presence, the existence of Ferris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you
      will be sick after all this fatigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Mrs. Vervain, it&rsquo;ll be no use offering <i>me</i> a glass of wine.
      I&rsquo;m sent away, you see,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;And Miss Vervain is quite right.
      Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;<i>good</i> night, Mr. Ferris,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, giving her
      hand. &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida did not look towards him. She gathered her mother&rsquo;s shawl about
      her shoulders for the twentieth time that day, and softly urged her in
      doors, while Ferris let himself out into the campo.

    <h2>
      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Florida began to prepare the bed for her mother&rsquo;s lying down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing that for, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to
      bed at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mother&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Florida. And I mean it. You are too headstrong. I should think you
      would see yourself how you suffer in the end by giving way to your violent
      temper. What a day you have made for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very wrong,&rdquo; murmured the proud girl, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the mortification of an apology; you might have spared yourself
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t mortify me; I didn&rsquo;t care for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I really believe you are too haughty to mind humbling yourself. And
      Don Ippolito had been so uniformly kind to us. I begin to believe that Mr.
      Ferris caught your true character in that sketch. But your pride will be
      broken some day, Florida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me help you undress, mother? You can talk to me while
      you&rsquo;re undressing. You must try to get some rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am all unstrung. Why couldn&rsquo;t you have let him come in and talk
      awhile? It would have been the best way to get me quieted down. But no;
      you must always have your own way Don&rsquo;t twitch me, my dear; I&rsquo;d rather
      undress myself. You pretend to be very careful of me. I wonder if you
      really care for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, you are all I have in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain began to whimper. &ldquo;You talk as if I were any better off. Have
      I anybody besides you? And I have lost so many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of those things now, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain tenderly kissed the young girl. &ldquo;You are good to your mother.
      Don Ippolito was right; no one ever saw you offer me disrespect or
      unkindness. There, there! Don&rsquo;t cry, my darling. I think I <i>had</i>
      better lie down, and I&rsquo;ll let you undress me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suffered herself to be helped into bed, and Florida went softly about
      the room, putting it in order, and drawing the curtains closer to keep out
      the near dawn. Her mother talked a little while, and presently fell from
      incoherence to silence, and so to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida looked hesitatingly at her for a moment, and then set her candle
      on the floor and sank wearily into an arm-chair beside the bed. Her hands
      fell into her lap; her head drooped sadly forward; the light flung the
      shadow of her face grotesquely exaggerated and foreshortened upon the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a bird piped in the garden; the shriek of a swallow made itself
      heard from a distance; the vernal day was beginning to stir from the
      light, brief drowse of the vernal night. A crown of angry red formed upon
      the candle wick, which toppled over in the socket and guttered out with a
      sharp hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida started from her chair. A streak of sunshine pierced shutter and
      curtain. Her mother was supporting herself on one elbow in the bed, and
      looking at her as if she had just called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, did you speak?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain turned her face away; she sighed deeply, stretched her thin
      hands on the pillow, and seemed to be sinking, sinking down through the
      bed. She ceased to breathe and lay in a dead faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida felt rather than saw it all. She did not cry out nor call for
      help. She brought water and cologne, and bathed her mother&rsquo;s face, and
      then chafed her hands. Mrs. Vervain slowly revived; she opened her eyes,
      then closed them; she did not speak, but after a while she began to fetch
      her breath with the long and even respirations of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida noiselessly opened the door, and met the servant with a tray of
      coffee. She put her finger to her lip, and motioned her not to enter,
      asking in a whisper: &ldquo;What time is it, Nina? I forgot to wind my watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock, signorina; and I thought you would be tired this
      morning, and would like your coffee in bed. Oh, misericordia!&rdquo; cried the
      girl, still in whisper, with a glance through the doorway, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t
      been in bed at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother doesn&rsquo;t seem well. I sat down beside her, and fell asleep in my
      chair without knowing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor little thing! Then you must drink your coffee at once. It
      refreshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Florida, closing the door, and pointing to a table in the
      next room, &ldquo;put it down here. I will serve myself, Nina. Go call the
      gondola, please. I am going out, at once, and I want you to go with me.
      Tell Checa to come here and stay with my mother till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She poured out a cup of coffee with a trembling hand, and hastily drank
      it; then bathing her eyes, she went to the glass and bestowed a touch or
      two upon yesterday&rsquo;s toilet, studied the effect a moment, and turned away.
      She ran back for another look, and the next moment she was walking down to
      the water-gate, where she found Nina waiting her in the gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rapid course brought them to Ferris&rsquo;s landing. &ldquo;Ring,&rdquo; she said to the
      gondolier, &ldquo;and say that one of the American ladies wishes to see the
      consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris was standing on the balcony over her, where he had been watching
      her approach in mute wonder. &ldquo;Why, Miss Vervain,&rdquo; he called down, &ldquo;what in
      the world is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I want to see you,&rdquo; said Florida, looking up with a wistful
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please. Or no, I had better come up. Yes, Nina and I will come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris met them at the lower door and led them to his apartment. Nina sat
      down in the outer room, and Florida followed the painter into his studio.
      Though her face was so wan, it seemed to him that he had never seen it
      lovelier, and he had a strange pride in her being there, though the
      disorder of the place ought to have humbled him. She looked over it with a
      certain childlike, timid curiosity, and something of that lofty compassion
      with which young ladies regard the haunts of men when they come into them
      by chance; in doing this she had a haughty, slow turn of the head that
      fascinated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mind the smell,&rdquo; which was a mingled one of
      oil-colors and tobacco-smoke. &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s putting my office to rights,
      and it&rsquo;s all in a cloud of dust. So I have to bring you in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida sat down on a chair fronting the easel, and found herself looking
      into the sad eyes of Don Ippolito. Ferris brusquely turned the back of the
      canvas toward her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean you to see that. It isn&rsquo;t ready to show,
      yet,&rdquo; he said, and then he stood expectantly before her. He waited for her
      to speak, for he never knew how to take Miss Vervain; he was willing
      enough to make light of her grand moods, but now she was too evidently
      unhappy for mocking; at the same time he did not care to invoke a snub by
      a prematurely sympathetic demeanor. His mind ran on the events of the day
      before, and he thought this visit probably related somehow to Don
      Ippolito. But his visitor did not speak, and at last he said: &ldquo;I hope
      there&rsquo;s nothing wrong at home, Miss Vervain. It&rsquo;s rather odd to have
      yesterday, last night, and next morning all run together as they have been
      for me in the last twenty-four hours. I trust Mrs. Vervain is turning the
      whole thing into a good solid oblivion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about&mdash;it&rsquo;s about&mdash;I came to see you&rdquo;&mdash;said Florida,
      hoarsely. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she hurried on to say, &ldquo;that I want to ask you who is
      the best doctor here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was not about Don Ippolito. &ldquo;Is your mother sick?&rdquo; asked Ferris,
      eagerly. &ldquo;She must have been fearfully tired by that unlucky expedition of
      ours. I hope there&rsquo;s nothing serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! But she is not well. She is very frail, you know. You must have
      noticed how frail she is,&rdquo; said Florida, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris had noticed that all his countrywomen, past their girlhood, seemed
      to be sick, he did not know how or why; he supposed it was all right, it
      was so common. In Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s case, though she talked a great deal
      about her ill-health, he had noticed it rather less than usual, she had so
      great spirit. He recalled now that he <i>had</i> thought her at times
      rather a shadowy presence, and that occasionally it had amused him that so
      slight a structure should hang together as it did&mdash;not only
      successfully, but triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said yes, he knew that Mrs. Vervain was not strong, and Florida
      continued: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only advice that I want for her, but I think we had
      better see some one&mdash;or know some one that we could go to in need. We
      are so far from any one we know, or help of any kind.&rdquo; She seemed to be
      trying to account to herself, rather than to Ferris, for what she was
      doing. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let anything pass unnoticed&rdquo;.... She looked at him
      entreatingly, but a shadow, as of some wounding memory, passed over her
      face, and she said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you to a doctor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Ferris, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please, I won&rsquo;t trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> you to go with me, please. I&rsquo;d rather go alone.&rdquo;
       Ferris looked at her perplexedly, as she rose. &ldquo;Just give me the address,
      and I shall manage best by myself. I&rsquo;m used to doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like. Wait a moment.&rdquo; Ferris wrote the address. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said,
      giving it to her; &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Florida with awkward hesitation, and a half-defiant,
      half-imploring look at him. &ldquo;You must have all sorts of people applying to
      you, as a consul; and you look after their affairs&mdash;and try to forget
      them&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t remember that I&rsquo;ve asked this favor of you; that
      you&rsquo;d consider it a&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consular service? With all my heart,&rdquo; answered Ferris, thinking for the
      third or fourth time how very young Miss Vervain was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good; you are kinder than I have any right,&rdquo; said Florida,
      smiling piteously. &ldquo;I only mean, don&rsquo;t speak of it to my mother. Not,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;but what I want her to know everything I do; but it would worry
      her if she thought I was anxious about her. Oh! I wish I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began a hasty search for her handkerchief; he saw her lips tremble and
      his soul trembled with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment, &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she said briskly, with a sort of airy
      sob, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to come down, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drifted out of the room and down the stairs, the servant-maid falling
      into her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris filled his pipe and went out on his balcony again, and stood
      watching the gondola in its course toward the address he had given, and
      smoking thoughtfully. It was really the same girl who had given poor Don
      Ippolito that cruel slap in the face, yesterday. But that seemed no more
      out of reason than her sudden, generous, exaggerated remorse both were of
      a piece with her coming to him for help now, holding him at a distance,
      flinging herself upon his sympathy, and then trying to snub him, and
      breaking down in the effort. It was all of a piece, and the piece was bad;
      yes, she had an ugly temper; and yet she had magnanimous traits too. These
      contradictions, which in his reverie he felt rather than formulated, made
      him smile, as he stood on his balcony bathed by the morning air and
      sunlight, in fresh, strong ignorance of the whole mystery of women&rsquo;s
      nerves. These caprices even charmed him. He reflected that he had gone on
      doing the Vervains one favor after another in spite of Florida&rsquo;s childish
      petulancies; and he resolved that he would not stop now; her whims should
      be nothing to him, as they had been nothing, hitherto. It is flattering to
      a man to be indispensable to a woman so long as he is not obliged to it;
      Miss Vervain&rsquo;s dependent relation to himself in this visit gave her a
      grace in Ferris&rsquo;s eyes which she had wanted before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time he saw her gondola stop, turn round, and come back to the
      canal that bordered the Vervain garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another change of mind,&rdquo; thought Ferris, complacently; and rising
      superior to the whole fitful sex, he released himself from uneasiness on
      Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s account. But in the evening he went to ask after her. He
      first sent his card to Florida, having written on it, &ldquo;I hope Mrs. Vervain
      is better. Don&rsquo;t let me come in if it&rsquo;s any disturbance.&rdquo; He looked for a
      moment at what he had written, dimly conscious that it was patronizing,
      and when he entered he saw that Miss Vervain stood on the defensive and
      from some willfulness meant to make him feel that he was presumptuous in
      coming; it did not comfort him to consider that she was very young.
      &ldquo;Mother will be in directly,&rdquo; said Florida in a tone that relegated their
      morning&rsquo;s interview to the age of fable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain came in smiling and cordial, apparently better and not worse
      for yesterday&rsquo;s misadventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I pick up quickly,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old campaigner, you know.
      Perhaps a little <i>too</i> old, now. Years do make a difference; and
      you&rsquo;ll find it out as you get on, Mr. Ferris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Ferris, not caring to have Mrs. Vervain treat him so
      much like a boy. &ldquo;Even at twenty-six I found it pleasant to take a nap
      this afternoon. How does one stand it at seventeen, Miss Vervain?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt the need of sleep,&rdquo; replied Florida, indifferently, and he
      felt shelved, as an old fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an empty, frivolous visit, to his thinking. Mrs. Vervain asked if
      he had seen Don Ippolito, and wondered that the priest had not come about,
      all day. She told a long story, and at the end tapped herself on the mouth
      with her fan to punish a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris rose to go. Mrs. Vervain wondered again in the same words why Don
      Ippolito had not been near them all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a wise man,&rdquo; said Ferris with bitterness, &ldquo;and knows when to
      time his visits.&rdquo; Mrs. Vervain did not notice his bitterness, but
      something made Florida follow him to the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s moonlight!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and she glanced at him as though she
      had some purpose of atonement in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not have it. &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a moon,&rdquo; he said moodily.
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; answered Florida, and she impulsively offered him her hand.
      He thought that it shook in his, but it was probably the agitation of his
      own nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soreness that had been lifted from his heart, came back; he walked home
      disappointed and defeated, he hardly knew why or in what. He did not laugh
      now to think how she had asked him that morning to forget her coming to
      him for help; he was outraged that he should have been repaid in this
      sort, and the rebuff with which his sympathy had just been met was vulgar;
      there was no other name for it but vulgarity. Yet he could not relate this
      quality to the face of the young girl as he constantly beheld it in his
      homeward walk. It did not defy him or repulse him; it looked up at him
      wistfully as from the gondola that morning. Nevertheless he hardened his
      heart. The Vervains should see him next when they had sent for him. After
      all, one is not so very old at twenty-six.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito has come, signorina,&rdquo; said Nina, the next morning,
      approaching Florida, where she sat in an attitude of listless patience, in
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito!&rdquo; echoed the young girl in a weary tone. She rose and went
      into the house, and they met with the constraint which was but too natural
      after the events of their last parting. It is hard to tell which has most
      to overcome in such a case, the forgiver or the forgiven. Pardon rankles
      even in a generous soul, and the memory of having pardoned embarrasses the
      sensitive spirit before the object of its clemency, humbling and making it
      ashamed. It would be well, I suppose, if there need be nothing of the kind
      between human creatures, who cannot sustain such a relation without mutual
      distrust. It is not so ill with them when apart, but when they meet they
      must be cold and shy at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I see what you two are thinking about,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, and a
      faint blush tinged the cheek of the priest as she thus paired him off with
      her daughter. &ldquo;You are thinking about what happened the other day; and you
      had better forget it. There is no use brooding over these matters. Dear
      me! if <i>I</i> had stopped to brood over every little unpleasant thing
      that happened, I wonder where I should be now? By the way, where were <i>you</i>
      all day yesterday, Don Ippolito?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come to disturb you because I thought you must be very tired.
      Besides I was quite busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, those inventions of yours. I think you are <i>so</i> ingenious!
      But you mustn&rsquo;t apply too closely. Now really, yesterday,&mdash;after all
      you had been through, it was too much for the brain.&rdquo; She tapped herself
      on the forehead with her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not busy with my inventions, madama,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito, who
      sat in the womanish attitude priests get from their drapery, and fingered
      the cord round his three-cornered hat. &ldquo;I have scarcely touched them of
      late. But our parish takes part in the procession of Corpus Domini in the
      Piazza, and I had my share of the preparations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure! When is it to be? We must all go. Our Nina has been
      telling Florida of the grand sights,&mdash;little children dressed up like
      John the Baptist, leading lambs. I suppose it&rsquo;s a great event with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest shrugged his shoulders, and opened both his hands, so that his
      hat slid to the floor, bumping and tumbling some distance away. He
      recovered it and sat down again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an observance,&rdquo; he said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall you be in the procession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be there with the other priests of my parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;We shall be looking out for you. I
      shall feel greatly honored to think I actually know some one in the
      procession. I&rsquo;m going to give you a little nod. You won&rsquo;t think it very
      wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saved him from the embarrassment he might have felt in replying, by an
      abrupt lapse from all apparent interest in the subject. She turned to her
      daughter, and said with a querulous accent, &ldquo;I wish you would throw the
      afghan over my feet, Florida, and make me a little comfortable before you
      begin your reading this morning.&rdquo; At the same time she feebly disposed
      herself among the sofa cushions on which she reclined, and waited for some
      final touches from her daughter. Then she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to close
      my eyes, but I shall hear every word. You are getting a beautiful accent,
      my dear, I know you are. I should think Goldoni must have a very smooth,
      agreeable style; hasn&rsquo;t he now, in Italian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began to read the comedy; after fifteen or twenty minutes Mrs.
      Vervain opened her eyes and said, &ldquo;But before you commence, Florida, I
      wish you&rsquo;d play a little, to get me quieted down. I feel so very flighty.
      I suppose it&rsquo;s this sirocco. And I believe I&rsquo;ll lie down in the next
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida followed her to repeat the arrangements for her comfort. Then she
      returned, and sitting down at the piano struck with a sort of soft
      firmness a few low, soothing chords, out of which a lulling melody grew.
      With her fingers still resting on the keys she turned her stately head,
      and glanced through the open door at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito,&rdquo; she asked softly, &ldquo;is there anything in the air of Venice
      that makes people very drowsy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard that, madamigella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; continued the young girl absently, &ldquo;why my mother wants to
      sleep so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she has not recovered from the fatigues of the other night,&rdquo;
       suggested the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Florida, sadly looking toward her mother&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned again to the instrument, and let her fingers wander over the
      keys, with a drooping head. Presently she lifted her face, and smoothed
      back from her temples some straggling tendrils of hair. Without looking at
      the priest she asked with the child-like bluntness that characterized her,
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like to walk in the procession of Corpus Domini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito&rsquo;s color came and went, and he answered evasively, &ldquo;I have not
      said that I did not like to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is true,&rdquo; said Florida, letting her fingers drop again on the
      keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito rose from the sofa where he had been sitting beside her while
      they read, and walked the length of the room. Then he came towards her and
      said meekly, &ldquo;Madamigella, I did not mean to repel any interest you feel
      in me. But it was a strange question to ask a priest, as I remembered I
      was when you asked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you always remember that?&rdquo; demanded the girl, still without turning
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; sometimes I am suffered to forget it,&rdquo; he said with a tentative
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not respond, and he drew a long breath, and walked away in
      silence. She let her hands fall into her lap, and sat in an attitude of
      expectation. As Don Ippolito came near her again he paused a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in this house that I forget my priesthood,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and it is
      the first of your kindnesses that you suffer me to do so, your good
      mother, there, and you. How shall I repay you? It cut me to the heart that
      you should ask forgiveness of me when you did, though I was hurt by your
      rebuke. Oh, had you not the right to rebuke me if I abused the delicate
      unreserve with which you had always treated me? But believe me, I meant no
      wrong, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice shook, and Florida broke in, &ldquo;You did nothing wrong. It was I
      who was cruel for no cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. You shall not say that,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;And why should I have
      cared for a few words, when all your acts had expressed a trust of me that
      is like heaven to my soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned now and looked at him, and he went on. &ldquo;Ah, I see you do not
      understand! How could you know what it is to be a priest in this most
      unhappy city? To be haunted by the strict espionage of all your own class,
      to be shunned as a spy by all who are not of it! But you two have not put
      up that barrier which everywhere shuts me out from my kind. You have been
      willing to see the man in me, and to let me forget the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what to say to you, Don Ippolito. I am only a foreigner, a
      girl, and I am very ignorant of these things,&rdquo; said Florida with a slight
      alarm. &ldquo;I am afraid that you may be saying what you will be sorry for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh never! Do not fear for me if I am frank with you. It is my refuge from
      despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passionate vibration of his voice increased, as if it must break in
      tears. She glanced towards the other room with a little movement or stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid of listening to me!&rdquo; cried the priest bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not wake her,&rdquo; said Florida calmly, after an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how you speak the thing you mean, always, always, always! You could
      not deny that you meant to wake her, for you have the life-long habit of
      the truth. Do you know what it is to have the life-long habit of a lie? It
      is to be a priest. Do you know what it is to seem, to say, to do, the
      thing you are not, think not, will not? To leave what you believe
      unspoken, what you will undone, what you are unknown? It is to be a
      priest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito spoke in Italian, and he uttered these words in a voice
      carefully guarded from every listener but the one before his face. &ldquo;Do you
      know what it is when such a moment as this comes, and you would fling away
      the whole fabric of falsehood that has clothed your life&mdash;do you know
      what it is to keep still so much of it as will help you to unmask silently
      and secretly? It is to be a priest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had lost its vehemence, and his manner was strangely subdued and
      cold. The sort of gentle apathy it expressed, together with a certain sad,
      impersonal surprise at the difference between his own and the happier
      fortune with which he contrasted it, was more touching than any tragic
      demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she felt the fascination of the pathos which she could not fully
      analyze, the young girl sat silent. After a time, in which she seemed to
      be trying to think it all out, she asked in a low, deep murmur: &ldquo;Why did
      you become a priest, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito. &ldquo;I will not trouble you with it
      now. Some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; now,&rdquo; answered Florida, in English. &ldquo;If you hate so to be a priest, I
      can&rsquo;t understand why you should have allowed yourself to become one. We
      should be very unhappy if we could not respect you,&mdash;not trust you as
      we have done; and how could we, if we knew you were not true to yourself
      in being what you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madamigella,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I never dared believe that I was in the
      smallest thing necessary to your happiness. Is it true, then, that you
      care for my being rather this than that? That you are in the least grieved
      by any wrong of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely know what you mean. How could we help being grieved by what
      you have said to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; but why do you care whether a priest of my church loves his
      calling or not,&mdash;you, a Protestant? It is that you are sorry for me
      as an unhappy man, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is that and more. I am no Catholic, but we are both Christians&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito gave the faintest movement of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;and I cannot endure to think of your doing the things you must do
      as a priest, and yet hating to be a priest. It is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are all the priests of your faith devotees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot be. But are none of yours so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God forbid that I should say that. I have known real saints among
      them. That friend of mine in Padua, of whom I once told you, became such,
      and died an angel fit for Paradise. And I suppose that my poor uncle is a
      saint, too, in his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle? A priest? You have never mentioned him to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito. After a certain pause he began abruptly, &ldquo;We are
      of the people, my family, and in each generation we have sought to honor
      our blood by devoting one of the race to the church. When I was a child, I
      used to divert myself by making little figures out of wood and pasteboard,
      and I drew rude copies of the pictures I saw at church. We lived in the
      house where I live now, and where I was born, and my mother let me play in
      the small chamber where I now have my forge; it was anciently the oratory
      of the noble family that occupied the whole palace. I contrived an altar
      at one end of it; I stuck my pictures about the walls, and I ranged the
      puppets in the order of worshippers on the floor; then I played at saying
      mass, and preached to them all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was a widow. She used to watch me with tears in her eyes. At
      last, one day, she brought my uncle to see me: I remember it all far
      better than yesterday. &lsquo;Is it not the will of God?&rsquo; she asked. My uncle
      called me to him, and asked me whether I should like to be a priest in
      good earnest, when I grew up? &lsquo;Shall I then be able to make as many little
      figures as I like, and to paint pictures, and carve an altar like that in
      your church?&rsquo; I demanded. My uncle answered that I should have real men
      and women to preach to, as he had, and would not that be much finer? In my
      heart I did not think so, for I did not care for that part of it; I only
      liked to preach to my puppets because I had made them. But said, &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; 
      as children do. I kept on contriving the toys that I played with, and I
      grew used to hearing it told among my mates and about the neighborhood
      that I was to be a priest; I cannot remember any other talk with my
      mother, and I do not know how or when it was decided. Whenever I thought
      of the matter, I thought, &lsquo;That will be very well. The priests have very
      little to do, and they gain a great deal of money with their masses; and I
      shall be able to make whatever I like.&rsquo; I only considered the office then
      as a means to gratify the passion that has always filled my soul for
      inventions and works of mechanical skill and ingenuity. My inclination was
      purely secular, but I was as inevitably becoming a priest as if I had been
      born to be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were not forced? There was no pressure upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there was merely an absence, so far as they were concerned, of any
      other idea. I think they meant justly, and assuredly they meant kindly by
      me. I grew in years, and the time came when I was to begin my studies. It
      was my uncle&rsquo;s influence that placed me in the Seminary of the Salute, and
      there I repaid his care by the utmost diligence. But it was not the
      theological studies that I loved, it was the mathematics and their
      practical application, and among the classics I loved best the poets and
      the historians. Yes, I can see that I was always a mundane spirit, and
      some of those in charge of me at once divined it, I think. They used to
      take us to walk,&mdash;you have seen the little creatures in their
      priest&rsquo;s gowns, which they put on when they enter the school, with a
      couple of young priests at the head of the file,&mdash;and once, for an
      uncommon pleasure, they took us to the Arsenal, and let us see the
      shipyards and the museum. You know the wonderful things that are there:
      the flags and the guns captured from the Turks; the strange weapons of all
      devices; the famous suits of armor. I came back half-crazed; I wept that I
      must leave the place. But I set to work the best I could to carve out in
      wood an invention which the model of one of the antique galleys had
      suggested to me. They found it,&mdash;nothing can be concealed outside of
      your own breast in such a school,&mdash;and they carried me with my
      contrivance before the superior. He looked kindly but gravely at me: &lsquo;My
      son,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;do you wish to be a priest?&rsquo; &lsquo;Surely, reverend father,&rsquo; I
      answered in alarm, &lsquo;why not?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because these things are not for priests.
      Their thoughts must be upon other things. Consider well of it, my son,
      while there is yet time,&rsquo; he said, and he addressed me a long and serious
      discourse upon the life on which I was to enter. He was a just and
      conscientious and affectionate man; but every word fell like burning fire
      in my heart. At the end, he took my poor plaything, and thrust it down
      among the coals of his <i>scaldino</i>. It made the scaldino smoke, and he
      bade me carry it out with me, and so turned again to his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was by this time dead, but I could hardly have gone to her, if
      she had still been living. &lsquo;These things are not for priests!&rsquo; kept
      repeating itself night and day in my brain. I was in despair, I was in a
      fury to see my uncle. I poured out my heart to him, and tried to make him
      understand the illusions and vain hopes in which I had lived. He received
      coldly my sorrow and the reproaches which I did not spare him; he bade me
      consider my inclinations as so many temptations to be overcome for the
      good of my soul and the glory of God. He warned me against the scandal of
      attempting to withdraw now from the path marked out for me. I said that I
      never would be a priest. &lsquo;And what will you do?&rsquo; he asked. Alas! what
      could I do? I went back to my prison, and in due course I became a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not without sufficient warning that I took one order after
      another, but my uncle&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;What will you do?&rsquo; made me deaf to these
      admonitions. All that is now past. I no longer resent nor hate; I seem to
      have lost the power; but those were days when my soul was filled with
      bitterness. Something of this must have showed itself to those who had me
      in their charge. I have heard that at one time my superiors had grave
      doubts whether I ought to be allowed to take orders. My examination, in
      which the difficulties of the sacerdotal life were brought before me with
      the greatest clearness, was severe; I do not know how I passed it; it must
      have been in grace to my uncle. I spent the next ten days in a convent, to
      meditate upon the step I was about to take. Poor helpless, friendless
      wretch! Madamigella, even yet I cannot see how I was to blame, that I came
      forth and received the first of the holy orders, and in their time the
      second and the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a priest, but no more a priest at heart than those Venetian
      conscripts, whom you saw carried away last week, are Austrian soldiers. I
      was bound as they are bound, by an inexorable and inevitable law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked me why I became a priest. Perhaps I have not told you why,
      but I have told you how&mdash;I have given you the slight outward events,
      not the processes of my mind&mdash;and that is all that I can do. If the
      guilt was mine, I have suffered for it. If it was not mine, still I have
      suffered for it. Some ban seems to have rested upon whatever I have
      attempted. My work,&mdash;oh, I know it well enough!&mdash;has all been
      cursed with futility; my labors are miserable failures or contemptible
      successes. I have had my unselfish dreams of blessing mankind by some
      great discovery or invention; but my life has been barren, barren, barren;
      and save for the kindness that I have known in this house, and that would
      not let me despair, it would now be without hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, and the girl, who had listened with her proud looks
      transfigured to an aspect of grieving pity, fetched a long sigh. &ldquo;Oh, I am
      sorry for you!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;more sorry than I know how to tell. But you
      must not lose courage, you must not give up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito resumed with a melancholy smile. &ldquo;There are doubtless
      temptations enough to be false under the best of conditions in this world.
      But something&mdash;I do not know what or whom; perhaps no more my uncle
      or my mother than I, for they were only as the past had made them&mdash;caused
      me to begin by living a lie, do you not see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; reluctantly assented the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;that is why no good has come of me, nor
      can come. My uncle&rsquo;s piety and repute have always been my efficient help.
      He is the principal priest of the church to which I am attached, and he
      has had infinite patience with me. My ambition and my attempted inventions
      are a scandal to him, for he is a priest of those like the Holy Father,
      who believe that all the wickedness of the modern world has come from the
      devices of science; my indifference to the things of religion is a terror
      and a sorrow to him which he combats with prayers and penances. He starves
      himself and goes cold and faint that God may have mercy and turn my heart
      to the things on which his own is fixed. He loves my soul, but not me, and
      we are scarcely friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida continued to look at him with steadfast, compassionate eyes. &ldquo;It
      seems very strange, almost like some dream,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that you
      should be saying all this to me, Don Ippolito, and I do not know why I
      should have asked you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pity of this virginal heart must have been very sweet to the man on
      whom she looked it. His eyes worshipped her, as he answered her devoutly,
      &ldquo;It was due to the truth in you that I should seem to you what I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you make me ashamed!&rdquo; she cried with a blush. &ldquo;It was selfish of
      me to ask you to speak. And now, after what you have told me, I am so
      helpless and I know so very little that I don&rsquo;t understand how to comfort
      or encourage you. But surely you can somehow help yourself. Are men, that
      seem so strong and able, just as powerless as women, after all, when it
      comes to real trouble? Is a man&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot answer. I am only a priest,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito coldly, letting
      his eyes drop to the gown that fell about him like a woman&rsquo;s skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but a priest should be a man, and so much more; a priest&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Your own schemes have all failed, you say; then
      why do you not think of becoming a priest in reality, and getting the good
      there must be in such a calling? It is singular that I should venture to
      say such a thing to you, and it must seem presumptuous and ridiculous for
      me, a Protestant&mdash;but our ways are so different.&rdquo;... She paused,
      coloring deeply, then controlled herself, and added with grave composure,
      &ldquo;If you were to pray&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what, madamigella?&rdquo; asked the priest, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what!&rdquo; she echoed, opening her eyes full upon him. &ldquo;To God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito made no answer. He let his head fall so low upon his breast
      that she could see the sacerdotal tonsure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; she said, blushing again. &ldquo;I did not mean to wound
      your feelings as a Catholic. I have been very bold and intrusive. I ought
      to have remembered that people of your church have different ideas&mdash;that
      the saints&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito looked up with pensive irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the poor saints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Florida, very gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I believe in the saints as little as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you believe in your Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence in which Don Ippolito again dropped his head upon his
      breast. Florida leaned forward in her eagerness, and murmured, &ldquo;You
      believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest lifted his eyes and looked at her beseechingly. &ldquo;I do not
      know,&rdquo; he whispered. She met his gaze with one of dumb bewilderment. At
      last she said: &ldquo;Sometimes you baptize little children and receive them
      into the church in the name of God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor creatures come to you and confess their sins, and you absolve them,
      or order them to do penances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes when people are dying, you must stand by their death-beds
      and give them the last consolations of religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; moaned the girl, and fixed on Don Ippolito a long look of wonder and
      reproach, which he met with eyes of silent anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is terrible, madamigella,&rdquo; he said, rising. &ldquo;I know it. I would fain
      have lived single-heartedly, for I think I was made so; but now you see
      how black and deadly a lie my life is. It is worse than you could have
      imagined, is it not? It is worse than the life of the cruelest bigot, for
      he at least believes in himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, far worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at least, dear young lady,&rdquo; he went on piteously, &ldquo;believe me that I
      have the grace to abhor myself. It is not much, it is very, very little,
      but it is something. Do not wholly condemn me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn? Oh, I am sorry for you with my whole heart. Only, why must you
      tell me all this? No, no; you are not to blame. I made you speak; I made
      you put yourself to shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, dearest madamigella. I would unsay nothing now, if I could,
      unless to take away the pain I have given you. It has been more a relief
      than a shame to have all this known to you; and even if you should despise
      me&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t despise you; that isn&rsquo;t for me; but oh, I wish that I could help
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito shook his head. &ldquo;You cannot help me; but I thank you for your
      compassion; I shall never forget it.&rdquo; He lingered irresolutely with his
      hat in his hand. &ldquo;Shall we go on with the reading, madamigella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we will not read any more to-day,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I relieve you of the disturbance, madamigella,&rdquo; he said; and after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation he bowed sadly and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mechanically followed him to the door, with some little gestures and
      movements of a desire to keep him from going, yet let him go, and so
      turned back and sat down with her hands resting noiseless on the keys of
      the piano.

    <h2>
      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Don Ippolito did not come, but in the afternoon the
      postman brought a letter for Mrs. Vervain, couched in the priest&rsquo;s
      English, begging her indulgence until after the day of Corpus Christi, up
      to which time, he said, he should be too occupied for his visits of
      ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter reminded Mrs. Vervain that they had not seen Mr. Ferris for
      three days, and she sent to ask him to dinner. But he returned an excuse,
      and he was not to be had to breakfast the next morning for the asking. He
      was in open rebellion. Mrs. Vervain had herself rowed to the consular
      landing, and sent up her gondolier with another invitation to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter appeared on the balcony in the linen blouse which he wore at
      his work, and looked down with a frown on the smiling face of Mrs. Vervain
      for a moment without speaking. Then, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, then,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Vervain,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to keep you waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that. You&rsquo;ll be ready in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida met the painter with such gentleness that he felt his resentment
      to have been a stupid caprice, for which there was no ground in the world.
      He tried to recall his fading sense of outrage, but he found nothing in
      his mind but penitence. The sort of distraught humility with which she
      behaved gave her a novel fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was good, as Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s dinners always were, and there was
      a compliment to the painter in the presence of a favorite dish. When he
      saw this, &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Vervain, what is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pretend
      that you&rsquo;re treating me so well for nothing. You want something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want nothing but that you should not neglect your friends. We have
      been utterly deserted for three or four days. Don Ippolito has not been
      here, either; but <i>he</i> has some excuse; he has to get ready for
      Corpus Christi. He&rsquo;s going to be in the procession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he to appear with his flying machine, or his portable dining-table, or
      his automatic camera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain, beaming reproach. Florida&rsquo;s face clouded,
      and Ferris made haste to say that he did not know these inventions were
      sacred, and that he had no wish to blaspheme them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough what I meant,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;And now, we
      want you to get us a window to look out on the procession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what you want, is it? I thought you merely wanted me
      not to neglect my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you call that neglecting them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Vervain, Mrs. Vervain! What a mind you have! Is there anything else
      you want? Me to go with you, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t insist. You can take us to the window and leave us, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This clemency is indeed unexpected,&rdquo; replied Ferris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really quite
      unworthy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going on with the badinage customary between Mrs. Vervain and
      himself, when Florida protested,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I think we abuse Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my dear&mdash;I know it,&rdquo; cheerfully assented Mrs. Vervain.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly shocking. But what are we to do? We must abuse <i>somebody&rsquo;s</i>
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better stay at home. I&rsquo;d much rather not go,&rdquo; said the girl,
      tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Vervain,&rdquo; said Ferris gravely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry if you&rsquo;ve
      misunderstood my joking. I&rsquo;ve never yet seen the procession to advantage,
      and I&rsquo;d like very much to look on with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not tell whether she was grateful for his words, or annoyed. She
      resolutely said no more, but her mother took up the strain and discoursed
      long upon it, arranging all the particulars of their meeting and going
      together. Ferris was a little piqued, and began to wonder why Miss Vervain
      did not stay at home if she did not want to go. To be sure, she went
      everywhere with her mother but it was strange, with her habitual violent
      submissiveness, that she should have said anything in opposition to her
      mother&rsquo;s wish or purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Mrs. Vervain frankly withdrew for her nap, and Florida
      seemed to make a little haste to take some sewing in her hand, and sat
      down with the air of a woman willing to detain her visitor. Ferris was
      not such a stoic as not to be dimly flattered by this, but he was too much
      of a man to be fully aware how great an advance it might seem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we shall see most of the priests of Venice, and what they are
      like, in the procession to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you remember speaking to
      me about priests, the other day, Mr. Ferris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember it very well. I think I overdid it; and I couldn&rsquo;t
      perceive afterwards that I had shown any motive but a desire to make
      trouble for Don Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought that,&rdquo; answered Florida, seriously. &ldquo;What you said was
      true, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was and it wasn&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t know that it differed from
      anything else in the world, in that respect. It is true that there is a
      great distrust of the priests amongst the Italians. The young men hate
      them&mdash;or think they do&mdash;or say they do. Most educated men in
      middle life are materialists, and of course unfriendly to the priests.
      There are even women who are skeptical about religion. But I suspect that
      the largest number of all those who talk loudest against the priests are
      really subject to them. You must consider how very intimately they are
      bound up with every family in the most solemn relations of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the priests are generally bad men?&rdquo; asked the young girl
      shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, indeed. I don&rsquo;t see how things could hang together if it were
      so. There must be a great basis of sincerity and goodness in them, when
      all is said and done. It seems to me that at the worst they&rsquo;re merely
      professional people&mdash;poor fellows who have gone into the church for a
      living. You know it isn&rsquo;t often now that the sons of noble families take
      orders; the priests are mostly of humble origin; not that they&rsquo;re
      necessarily the worse for that; the patricians used to be just as bad in
      another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Florida, with her head on one side, considering her seam,
      &ldquo;why there is always something so dreadful to us in the idea of a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They <i>do</i> seem a kind of alien creature to us Protestants. I can&rsquo;t
      make out whether they seem so to Catholics, or not. But we have a
      repugnance to all doomed people, haven&rsquo;t we? And a priest is a man under
      sentence of death to the natural ties between himself and the human race.
      He is dead to us. That makes him dreadful. The spectre of our dearest
      friend, father or mother, would be terrible. And yet,&rdquo; added Ferris,
      musingly, &ldquo;a nun isn&rsquo;t terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because a woman&rsquo;s life even in the world
      seems to be a constant giving up. No, a nun isn&rsquo;t unnatural, but a priest
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a time, in which she sewed swiftly; then she suddenly
      dropped her work into her lap, and pressing it down with both hands, she
      asked, &ldquo;Do you believe that priests themselves are ever skeptical about
      religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it must happen now and then. In the best days of the church it
      was a fashion to doubt, you know. I&rsquo;ve often wanted to ask our friend Don
      Ippolito something about these matters, but I didn&rsquo;t see how it could be
      managed.&rdquo; Ferris did not note the change that passed over Florida&rsquo;s face,
      and he continued. &ldquo;Our acquaintance hasn&rsquo;t become so intimate as I hoped
      it might. But you only get to a certain point with Italians. They like to
      meet you on the street; maybe they haven&rsquo;t any indoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it must sometimes happen, as you say,&rdquo; replied Florida, with a quick
      sigh, reverting to the beginning of Ferris&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;But is it any worse
      for a false priest than for a hypocritical minister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough for either, but it&rsquo;s worse for the priest. You see Miss
      Vervain, a minister doesn&rsquo;t set up for so much. He doesn&rsquo;t pretend to
      forgive us our sins, and he doesn&rsquo;t ask us to confess them; he doesn&rsquo;t
      offer us the veritable body and blood in the sacrament, and he doesn&rsquo;t
      bear allegiance to the visible and tangible vicegerent of Christ upon
      earth. A hypocritical parson may be absurd; but a skeptical priest is
      tragical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh yes, I see,&rdquo; murmured the girl, with a grieving face. &ldquo;Are they
      always to blame for it? They must be induced, sometimes, to enter the
      church before they&rsquo;ve seriously thought about it, and then don&rsquo;t know how
      to escape from the path that has been marked out for them from their
      childhood. Should you think such a priest as that was to blame for being a
      skeptic?&rdquo; she asked very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ferris, with a smile at her seriousness, &ldquo;I should think such a
      skeptic as that was to blame for being a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be very sorry for him?&rdquo; pursued Florida still more
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, indeed, if I liked him. If I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m afraid I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
       said Ferris; but he saw that his levity jarred upon her. &ldquo;Come, Miss
      Vervain, you&rsquo;re not going to look at those fat monks and sleek priests in
      the procession to-morrow as so many incorporate tragedies, are you? You&rsquo;ll
      spoil my pleasure if you do. I dare say they&rsquo;ll be all of them devout
      believers, accepting everything, down to the animalcula in the holy
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>you</i> were that kind of a priest,&rdquo; persisted the girl, without
      heeding his jests, &ldquo;what should you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t imagine it. Why,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;think what a helpless creature a priest is in everything but his
      priesthood&mdash;more helpless than a woman, even. The only thing he could
      do would be to leave the church, and how could he do that? He&rsquo;s in the
      world, but he isn&rsquo;t of it, and I don&rsquo;t see what he could do with it, or it
      with him. If an Italian priest were to leave the church, even the
      liberals, who distrust him now, would despise him still more. Do you know
      that they have a pleasant fashion of calling the Protestant converts
      apostates? The first thing for such a priest would be exile. But I&rsquo;m not
      supposably the kind of priest you mean, and I don&rsquo;t think just such a
      priest supposable. I dare say if a priest found himself drifting into
      doubt, he&rsquo;d try to avoid the disagreeable subject, and, if he couldn&rsquo;t,
      he&rsquo;d philosophize it some way, and wouldn&rsquo;t let his skepticism worry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you mean that they haven&rsquo;t consciences like us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have consciences, but not like us. The Italians are kinder people
      than we are, but they&rsquo;re not so just, and I should say that they don&rsquo;t
      think truth the chief good of life. They believe there are pleasanter and
      better things. Perhaps they&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; you don&rsquo;t believe that, you know you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Florida,
      anxiously. &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t answered my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I have. I&rsquo;ve told you it wasn&rsquo;t a supposable case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I must,&rdquo; answered Ferris with a laugh. &ldquo;With my unfortunate
      bringing up, I couldn&rsquo;t say less than that such a man ought to get out of
      his priesthood at any hazard. He should cease to be a priest, if it cost
      him kindred, friends, good fame, country, everything. I don&rsquo;t see how
      there can be any living in such a lie, though I know there is. In all
      reason, it ought to eat the soul out of a man, and leave him helpless to
      do or be any sort of good. But there seems to be something, I don&rsquo;t know
      what it is, that is above all reason of ours, something that saves each of
      us for good in spite of the bad that&rsquo;s in us. It&rsquo;s very good practice, for
      a man who wants to be modest, to come and live in a Latin country. He
      learns to suspect his own topping virtues, and to be lenient to the novel
      combinations of right and wrong that he sees. But as for our insupposable
      priest&mdash;yes, I should say decidedly he ought to get out of it by all
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida fell back in her chair with an aspect of such relief as comes to
      one from confirmation on an important point. She passed her hand over the
      sewing in her lap, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris went on, with a doubting look at her, for he had been shy of
      introducing Don Ippolito&rsquo;s name since the day on the Brenta, and he did
      not know what effect a recurrence to him in this talk might have. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      often wondered if our own clerical friend were not a little shaky in his
      faith. I don&rsquo;t think nature meant him for a priest. He always strikes me
      as an extremely secular-minded person. I doubt if he&rsquo;s ever put the
      question whether he is what he professes to be, squarely to himself&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      such a mere dreamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida changed her posture slightly, and looked down at her sewing. She
      asked, &ldquo;But shouldn&rsquo;t you abhor him if he were a skeptical priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t find it such an easy matter to
      abhor people. It would be interesting,&rdquo; he continued musingly, &ldquo;to have
      such a dreamer waked up, once, and suddenly confronted with what he
      recognized as perfect truthfulness, and couldn&rsquo;t help contrasting himself
      with. But it would be a little cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather have him left as he was?&rdquo; asked Florida, lifting her
      eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a moralist, no; as a humanitarian, yes, Miss Vervain. He&rsquo;d be much
      happier as he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time ought we to be ready for you tomorrow?&rdquo; demanded the girl in a
      tone of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to be in the Piazza by nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Ferris, carelessly
      accepting the change of subject; and he told her of his plan for seeing
      the procession from a window of the Old Procuratie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose to go, he said lightly, &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, we may see the
      type of tragical priest we&rsquo;ve been talking about. Who can tell? I say his
      nose will be red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Florida, with unheeding gravity.

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day was one of those which can come to the world only in early June at
      Venice. The heaven was without a cloud, but a blue haze made mystery of
      the horizon where the lagoon and sky met unseen. The breath of the sea
      bathed in freshness the city at whose feet her tides sparkled and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great square of St. Mark was transformed from a mart, from a <i>salon</i>,
      to a temple. The shops under the colonnades that inclose it upon three
      sides were shut; the caffès, before which the circles of idle
      coffee-drinkers and sherbet-eaters ordinarily spread out into the Piazza,
      were repressed to the limits of their own doors; the stands of the
      water-venders, the baskets of those that sold oranges of Palermo and black
      cherries of Padua, had vanished from the base of the church of St. Mark,
      which with its dim splendor of mosaics and its carven luxury of pillar and
      arch and finial rose like the high-altar, ineffably rich and beautiful, of
      the vaster temple whose inclosure it completed. Before it stood the three
      great red flag-staffs, like painted tapers before an altar, and from them
      hung the Austrian flags of red and white, and yellow and black.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the square stood the Austrian military band, motionless,
      encircling their leader with his gold-headed staff uplifted. During the
      night a light colonnade of wood, roofed with blue cloth, had been put up
      around the inside of the Piazza, and under this now paused the long pomp
      of the ecclesiastical procession&mdash;the priests of all the Venetian
      churches in their richest vestments, followed in their order by facchini,
      in white sandals and gay robes, with caps of scarlet, white, green, and
      blue, who bore huge painted candles and silken banners displaying the
      symbol or the portrait of the titular saints of the several churches, and
      supported the canopies under which the host of each was elevated. Before
      the clergy went a company of Austrian soldiers, and behind the facchini
      came a long array of religious societies, charity-school boys in uniforms,
      old paupers in holiday dress, little naked urchins with shepherds&rsquo; crooks
      and bits of fleece about their loins like John the Baptist in the
      Wilderness, little girls with angels&rsquo; wings and crowns, the monks of the
      various orders, and civilian penitents of all sorts in cloaks or
      dress-coats, hooded or bareheaded, and carrying each a lighted taper. The
      corridors under the Imperial Palace and the New and Old Procuratie were
      packed with spectators; from every window up and down the fronts of the
      palaces, gay stuffs were flung; the startled doves of St. Mark perched
      upon the cornices, or fluttered uneasily to and fro above the crowd. The
      baton of the band leader descended with a crash of martial music, the
      priests chanted, the charity-boys sang shrill, a vast noise of shuffling
      feet arose, mixed with the foliage-like rustling of the sheets of tinsel
      attached to the banners and candles in the procession: the whole strange,
      gorgeous picture came to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all her plans and preparations, Mrs. Vervain had not felt well
      enough that morning to come to the spectacle which she had counted so much
      upon seeing, but she had therefore insisted the more that her daughter
      should go, and Ferris now stood with Florida alone at a window in the Old
      Procuratie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think, Miss Vervain?&rdquo; he asked, when their senses had
      somewhat accustomed themselves to the noise of the procession; &ldquo;do you say
      now that Venice is too gloomy a city to have ever had any possibility of
      gayety in her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; answered Florida, opening her eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; returned Ferris, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve often thought it, and I&rsquo;m not
      sure now but I&rsquo;m right. There&rsquo;s something extremely melancholy to me in
      all this. I don&rsquo;t care so much for what one may call the deplorable
      superstition expressed in the spectacle, but the mere splendid sight and
      the music are enough to make one shed tears. I don&rsquo;t know anything more
      affecting except a procession of lantern-lit gondolas and barges on the
      Grand Canal. It&rsquo;s phantasmal. It&rsquo;s the spectral resurrection of the old
      dead forms into the present. It&rsquo;s not even the ghost, it&rsquo;s the corpse of
      other ages that&rsquo;s haunting Venice. The city ought to have been destroyed
      by Napoleon when he destroyed the Republic, and thrown overboard&mdash;St.
      Mark, Winged Lion, Bucentaur, and all. There is no land like America for
      true cheerfulness and light-heartedness. Think of our Fourth of Julys and
      our State Fairs. Selah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris looked into the girl&rsquo;s serious face with twinkling eyes. He liked
      to embarrass her gravity with his antic speeches, and enjoyed her
      endeavors to find an earnest meaning in them, and her evident trouble when
      she could find none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to know how our friend will look,&rdquo; he began again, as he
      arranged the cushion on the window-sill for Florida&rsquo;s greater comfort in
      watching the spectacle, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t be an easy matter to pick him out in
      this masquerade, I fancy. Candle-carrying, as well as the other acts of
      devotion, seems rather out of character with Don Ippolito, and I can&rsquo;t
      imagine his putting much soul into it. However, very few of the clergy
      appear to do that. Look at those holy men with their eyes to the wind!
      They are wondering who is the <i>bella bionda</i> at the window here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida listened to his persiflage with an air of sad distraction. She was
      intent upon the procession as it approached from the other side of the
      Piazza, and she replied at random to his comments on the different bodies
      that formed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to decide which are my favorites,&rdquo; he continued, surveying
      the long column through an opera-glass. &ldquo;My religious disadvantages have
      been such that I don&rsquo;t care much for priests or monks, or young John the
      Baptists, or small female cherubim, but I do like little charity-boys with
      voices of pins and needles and hair cut <i>à la</i> dead-rabbit. I should
      like, if it were consistent with the consular dignity, to go down and rub
      their heads. I&rsquo;m fond, also, of <i>old</i> charity-boys, I find. Those
      paupers make one in love with destitute and dependent age, by their aspect
      of irresponsible enjoyment. See how briskly each of them topples along on
      the leg that he hasn&rsquo;t got in the grave! How attractive likewise are the
      civilian devotees in those imperishable dress-coats of theirs! Observe
      their high collars of the era of the Holy Alliance: they and their fathers
      and their grandfathers before them have worn those dress-coats; in a
      hundred years from now their posterity will keep holiday in them. I should
      like to know the elixir by which the dress-coats of civil employees render
      themselves immortal. Those penitents in the cloaks and cowls are not bad,
      either, Miss Vervain. Come, they add a very pretty touch of mystery to
      this spectacle. They&rsquo;re the sort of thing that painters are expected to
      paint in Venice&mdash;that people sigh over as so peculiarly Venetian. If
      you&rsquo;ve a single sentiment about you, Miss Vervain, now is the time to
      produce it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m afraid I have no sentiment at all,&rdquo; answered the girl
      ruefully. &ldquo;But this makes me dreadfully sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s just what I was saying a while ago. Excuse me, Miss Vervain,
      but your sadness lacks novelty; it&rsquo;s a sort of plagiarism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please,&rdquo; she pleaded yet more earnestly. &ldquo;I was just thinking&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know why such an awful thought should come to me&mdash;that it might
      all be a mistake after all; perhaps there might not be any other world,
      and every bit of this power and display of the church&mdash;<i>our</i>
      church as well as the rest&mdash;might be only a cruel blunder, a dreadful
      mistake. Perhaps there isn&rsquo;t even any God! Do you think there is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> it,&rdquo; said Ferris gravely, &ldquo;I <i>know</i> it. But I
      don&rsquo;t wonder that this sight makes you doubt. Great God! How far it is
      from Christ! Look there, at those troops who go before the followers of
      the Lamb: their trade is murder. In a minute, if a dozen men called out,
      &lsquo;Long live the King of Italy!&rsquo; it would be the duty of those soldiers to
      fire into the helpless crowd. Look at the silken and gilded pomp of the
      servants of the carpenter&rsquo;s son! Look at those miserable monks, voluntary
      prisoners, beggars, aliens to their kind! Look at those penitents who
      think that they can get forgiveness for their sins by carrying a candle
      round the square! And it is nearly two thousand years since the world
      turned Christian! It is pretty slow. But I suppose God lets men learn Him
      from their own experience of evil. I imagine the kingdom of heaven is a
      sort of republic, and that God draws men to Him only through their perfect
      freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, it must be so,&rdquo; answered Florida, staring down on the crowd
      with unseeing eyes, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t fix my mind on it. I keep thinking the
      whole time of what we were talking about yesterday. I never could have
      dreamed of a priest&rsquo;s disbelieving; but now I can&rsquo;t dream of anything
      else. It seems to me that none of these priests or monks can believe
      anything. Their faces look false and sly and bad&mdash;<i>all</i> of
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Miss Vervain,&rdquo; said Ferris, smiling at her despair, &ldquo;you push
      matters a little beyond&mdash;as a woman has a right to do, of course. I
      don&rsquo;t think their faces are bad, by any means. Some of them are dull and
      torpid, and some are frivolous, just like the faces of other people. But
      I&rsquo;ve been noticing the number of good, kind, friendly faces, and they&rsquo;re
      in the majority, just as they are amongst other people; for there are very
      few souls altogether out of drawing, in my opinion. I&rsquo;ve even caught sight
      of some faces in which there was a real rapture of devotion, and now and
      then a very innocent one. Here, for instance, is a man I should like to
      bet on, if he&rsquo;d only look up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest whom Ferris indicated was slowly advancing toward the space
      immediately under their window. He was dressed in robes of high ceremony,
      and in his hand he carried a lighted taper. He moved with a gentle tread,
      and the droop of his slender figure intimated a sort of despairing
      weariness. While most of his fellows stared carelessly or curiously about
      them, his face was downcast and averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the procession paused, and a hush fell upon the vast assembly.
      Then the silence was broken by the rustle and stir of all those thousands
      going down upon their knees, as the cardinal-patriarch lifted his hands to
      bless them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest upon whom Ferris and Florida had fixed their eyes faltered a
      moment, and before he knelt his next neighbor had to pluck him by the
      skirt. Then he too knelt hastily, mechanically lifting his head, and
      glancing along the front of the Old Procuratie. His face had that
      weariness in it which his figure and movement had suggested, and it was
      very pale, but it was yet more singular for the troubled innocence which
      its traits expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; whispered Ferris, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I call an uncommonly good face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida raised her hand to silence him, and the heavy gaze of the priest
      rested on them coldly at first. Then a light of recognition shot into his
      eyes and a flush suffused his pallid visage, which seemed to grow the more
      haggard and desperate. His head fell again, and he dropped the candle from
      his hand. One of those beggars who went by the side of the procession, to
      gather the drippings of the tapers, restored it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Ferris aloud, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Don Ippolito! Did you know him at first?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ladies were sitting on the terrace when Don Ippolito came next morning
      to say that he could not read with Miss Vervain that day nor for several
      days after, alleging in excuse some priestly duties proper to the time.
      Mrs. Vervain began to lament that she had not been able to go to the
      procession of the day before. &ldquo;I meant to have kept a sharp lookout for
      you; Florida saw you, and so did Mr. Ferris. But it isn&rsquo;t at all the same
      thing, you know. Florida has no faculty for describing; and now I shall
      probably go away from Venice without seeing you in your real character
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito suffered this and more in meek silence. He waited his
      opportunity with unfailing politeness, and then with gentle punctilio took
      his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come again as soon as your duties will let you, Don Ippolito,&rdquo;
       cried Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;We shall miss you dreadfully, and I begrudge every
      one of your readings that Florida loses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest passed, with the sliding step which his impeding drapery
      imposed, down the garden walk, and was half-way to the gate, when Florida,
      who had stood watching him, said to her mother, &ldquo;I must speak to him
      again,&rdquo; and lightly descended the steps and swiftly glided in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito!&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      He already had his hand upon the gate, but he turned, and rapidly went
      back to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in the walk where she had stopped when her voice arrested him,
      breathing quickly. Their eyes met; a painful shadow overcast the face of
      the young girl, who seemed to be trying in vain to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain put on her glasses and peered down at the two with
      good-natured curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madamigella,&rdquo; said the priest at last, &ldquo;what do you command me?&rdquo; He
      gave a faint, patient sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears came into her eyes. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she began vehemently, &ldquo;I wish there
      was some one who had the right to speak to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito, &ldquo;has so much the right as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you yesterday,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;and I thought of what you had
      told me, Don Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought of it, too,&rdquo; answered the priest; &ldquo;I have thought of it
      ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you thought of any hope for yourself? Must you still go on as
      before? How can you go back now to those things, and pretend to think them
      holy, and all the time have no heart or faith in them? It&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you, madamigella?&rdquo; demanded Don Ippolito, with a moody shrug.
      &ldquo;It is my profession, my trade, you know. You might say to the prisoner,&rdquo;
       he added bitterly, &ldquo;&lsquo;It is terrible to see you chained here.&rsquo; Yes, it is
      terrible. Oh, I don&rsquo;t reject your compassion! But what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down with me here,&rdquo; said Florida in her blunt, child-like way, and
      sank upon the stone seat beside the walk. She clasped her hands together
      in her lap with some strong, bashful emotion, while Don Ippolito, obeying
      her command, waited for her to speak. Her voice was scarcely more than a
      hoarse whisper when she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin what I want to say. I am not fit to advise any
      one. I am so young, and so very ignorant of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too know little of the world,&rdquo; said the priest, as much to himself as
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be all wrong, all wrong. Besides,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;how do I
      know that you are a good man, Don Ippolito? How do I know that you&rsquo;ve been
      telling me the truth? It may be all a kind of trap&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked blankly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is in Venice; and you may be leading me on to say things to you that
      will make trouble for my mother and me. You may be a spy&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no, no!&rdquo; cried the priest, springing to his feet with a kind of
      moan, and a shudder, &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; He swiftly touched her hand with the
      tips of his fingers, and then kissed them: an action of inexpressible
      humility. &ldquo;Madamigella, I swear to you by everything you believe good that
      I would rather die than be false to you in a single breath or thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it, I know it,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could say
      such a cruel thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not cruel; no, madamigella, not cruel,&rdquo; softly pleaded Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but is there <i>no</i> escape for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked steadfastly at each other for a moment, and then Don Ippolito
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said very gravely, &ldquo;there is one way of escape. I have often
      thought of it, and once I thought I had taken the first step towards it;
      but it is beset with many great obstacles, and to be a priest makes one
      timid and insecure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lapsed into his musing melancholy with the last words; but she would
      not suffer him to lose whatever heart he had begun to speak with. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must think again of that way of escape, and never
      turn from it till you have tried it. Only take the first step and you can
      go on. Friends will rise up everywhere, and make it easy for you. Come,&rdquo;
       she implored him fervently, &ldquo;you must promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his dreamy eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should take this only way of escape, and it seemed desperate to all
      others, would you still be my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be your friend if the whole world turned against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be my friend,&rdquo; he asked eagerly in lower tones, and with signs
      of an inward struggle, &ldquo;if this way of escape were for me to be no longer
      a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes! Why not?&rdquo; cried the girl; and her face glowed with heroic
      sympathy and defiance. It is from this heaven-born ignorance in women of
      the insuperable difficulties of doing right that men take fire and
      accomplish the sublime impossibilities. Our sense of details, our fatal
      habits of reasoning paralyze us; we need the impulse of the pure ideal
      which we can get only from them. These two were alike children as regarded
      the world, but he had a man&rsquo;s dark prevision of the means, and she a
      heavenly scorn of everything but the end to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath. &ldquo;Then it does not seem terrible to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible? No! I don&rsquo;t see how you can rest till it is done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, then, that you urge me to this step, which indeed I have so
      long desired to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true! Listen, Don Ippolito: it is the very thing that I hoped
      you would do, but I wanted you to speak of it first. You must have all the
      honor of it, and I am glad you thought of it before. You will never regret
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled radiantly upon him, and he kindled at her enthusiasm. In
      another moment his face darkened again. &ldquo;But it will cost much,&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; cried Florida. &ldquo;Such a man as you ought to leave the
      priesthood at any risk or hazard. You should cease to be a priest, if it
      cost you kindred, friends, good fame, country, everything!&rdquo; She blushed
      with irrelevant consciousness. &ldquo;Why need you be downhearted? With your
      genius once free, you can make country and fame and friends everywhere.
      Leave Venice! There are other places. Think how inventors succeed in
      America&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In America!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest. &ldquo;Ah, how long I have desired to be
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go. You will soon be famous and honored there, and you shall not
      be a stranger, even at the first. Do you know that we are going home very
      soon? Yes, my mother and I have been talking of it to-day. We are both
      homesick, and you see that she is not well. You shall come to us there,
      and make our house your home till you have formed some plans of your own.
      Everything will be easy. God <i>is</i> good,&rdquo; she said in a breaking
      voice, &ldquo;and you may be sure he will befriend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;has already
      been very good to me. I thought it was you, but I will call it God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! You mustn&rsquo;t say such things. But you must go, now. Take time to
      think, but not too much time. Only,&mdash;be true to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose, and she laid her hand on his arm with an instinctive gesture of
      appeal. He stood bewildered. Then, &ldquo;Thanks, madamigella, thanks!&rdquo; he said,
      and caught her fragrant hand to his lips. He loosed it and lifted both his
      arms by a blind impulse in which he arrested himself with a burning blush,
      and turned away. He did not take leave of her with his wonted formalities,
      but hurried abruptly toward the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A panic seemed to seize her as she saw him open it. She ran after him.
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito, Don Ippolito,&rdquo; she said, coming up to him; and stammered
      and faltered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I am frightened. You must do nothing from me;
      I cannot let you; I&rsquo;m not fit to advise you. It must be wholly from your
      own conscience. Oh no, don&rsquo;t look so! I <i>will</i> be your friend,
      whatever happens. But if what you think of doing has seemed so terrible to
      you, perhaps it <i>is</i> more terrible than I can understand. If it is
      the only way, it is right. But is there no other? What I mean is, have you
      no one to talk all this over with? I mean, can&rsquo;t you speak of it to&mdash;to
      Mr. Ferris? He is so true and honest and just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to him,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, with a dim trouble in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad of that! Remember, I don&rsquo;t take anything back. No matter
      what happens, I will be your friend. But he will tell you just what to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito bowed and opened the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida went back to her mother, who asked her, &ldquo;What in the world have
      you and Don Ippolito been talking about so earnestly? What makes you so
      pale and out of breath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wanting to tell you, mother,&rdquo; said Florida. She drew her
      chair in front of the elder lady, and sat down.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito did not go directly to the painter&rsquo;s. He walked toward his
      house at first, and then turned aside, and wandered out through the noisy
      and populous district of Canaregio to the Campo di Marte. A squad of
      cavalry which had been going through some exercises there was moving off
      the parade ground; a few infantry soldiers were strolling about under the
      trees. Don Ippolito walked across the field to the border of the lagoon,
      where he began to pace to and fro, with his head sunk in deep thought. He
      moved rapidly, but sometimes he stopped and stood still in the sun, whose
      heat he did not seem to feel, though a perspiration bathed his pale face
      and stood in drops on his forehead under the shadow of his nicchio. Some
      little dirty children of the poor, with which this region swarms, looked
      at him from the sloping shore of the Campo di Giustizia, where the
      executions used to take place, and a small boy began to mock his movements
      and pauses, but was arrested by one of the girls, who shook him and
      gesticulated warningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the long railroad bridge which connects Venice with the
      mainland is in full sight, and now from the reverie in which he continued,
      whether he walked or stood still, Don Ippolito was roused by the whistle
      of an outward train. He followed it with his eye as it streamed along over
      the far-stretching arches, and struck out into the flat, salt marshes
      beyond. When the distance hid it, he put on his hat, which he had
      unknowingly removed, and turned his rapid steps toward the railroad
      station. Arrived there, he lingered in the vestibule for half an hour,
      watching the people as they bought their tickets for departure, and had
      their baggage examined by the customs officers, and weighed and registered
      by the railroad porters, who passed it through the wicket shutting out the
      train, while the passengers gathered up their smaller parcels and took
      their way to the waiting-rooms. He followed a group of English people some
      paces in this direction, and then returned to the wicket, through which he
      looked long and wistfully at the train. The baggage was all passed
      through; the doors of the waiting-rooms were thrown open with harsh
      proclamation by the guards, and the passengers flocked into the carriages.
      Whistles and bells were sounded, and the train crept out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in the company&rsquo;s uniform approached the unconscious priest, and
      striking his hands softly together, said with a pleasant smile, &ldquo;Your
      servant, Don Ippolito. Are you expecting some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good day!&rdquo; answered the priest, with a little start. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;I was not looking for any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Amusing yourself as usual with the machinery.
      Excuse the freedom, Don Ippolito; but you ought to have been of our
      profession,&mdash;ha, ha! When you have the leisure, I should like to show
      you the drawing of an American locomotive which a friend of mine has sent
      me from Nuova York. It is very different from ours, very curious. But
      monstrous in size, you know, prodigious! May I come with it to your house,
      some evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do me a great pleasure,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito. He gazed dreamily in
      the direction of the vanished train. &ldquo;Was that the train for Milan?&rdquo; he
      asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it go all the way to Milan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! it stops at Peschiera, where the passengers have their passports
      examined; and then another train backs down from Desenzano and takes them
      on to Milan. And after that,&rdquo; continued the man with animation, &ldquo;if you
      are on the way to England, for example, another train carries you to Susa,
      and there you get the diligence over the mountain to St. Michel, where you
      take railroad again, and so on up through Paris to Boulogne-sur-Mer, and
      then by steamer to Folkestone, and then by railroad to London and to
      Liverpool. It is at Liverpool that you go on board the steamer for
      America, and piff! in ten days you are in Nuova York. My friend has
      written me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, your friend. Does he like it there in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passably, passably. The Americans have no manners; but they are good
      devils. They are governed by the Irish. And the wine is dear. But he likes
      America; yes, he likes it. Nuova York is a fine city. But immense, you
      know! Eight times as large as Venice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your friend prosperous there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah heigh! That is the prettiest part of the story. He has made himself
      rich. He is employed by a large house to make designs for mantlepieces,
      and marble tables, and tombs; and he has&mdash;listen!&mdash;six hundred
      francs a month!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh per Bacco!&rdquo; cried Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly. But you spend a great deal there. Still, it is magnificent, is
      it not? If it were not for that blessed war there, now, that would be the
      place for you, Don Ippolito. He tells me the Americans are actually mad
      for inventions. Your servant. Excuse the freedom, you know,&rdquo; said the man,
      bowing and moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, dear, nothing,&rdquo; answered the priest. He walked out of the
      station with a light step, and went to his own house, where he sought the
      room in which his inventions were stored. He had not touched them for
      weeks. They were all dusty and many were cobwebbed. He blew the dust from
      some, and bringing them to the light, examined them critically, finding
      them mostly disabled in one way or other, except the models of the
      portable furniture which he polished with his handkerchief and set apart,
      surveying them from a distance with a look of hope. He took up the
      breech-loading cannon and then suddenly put it down again with a little
      shiver, and went to the threshold of the perverted oratory and glanced in
      at his forge. Veneranda had carelessly left the window open, and the
      draught had carried the ashes about the floor. On the cinder-heap lay the
      tools which he had used in mending the broken pipe of the fountain at Casa
      Vervain, and had not used since. The place seemed chilly even on that
      summer&rsquo;s day. He stood in the doorway with clenched hands. Then he called
      Veneranda, chid her for leaving the window open, and bade her close it,
      and so quitted the house and left her muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris seemed surprised to see him when he appeared at the consulate near
      the middle of the afternoon, and seated himself in the place where he was
      wont to pose for the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you going to give me a sitting?&rdquo; asked the latter, hesitating. &ldquo;The
      light is horrible, just now, with this glare from the canal. Not that I
      manage much better when it&rsquo;s good. I don&rsquo;t get on with you, Don Ippolito.
      There are too many of you. I shouldn&rsquo;t have known you in the procession
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito did not respond. He rose and went toward his portrait on the
      easel, and examined it long, with a curious minuteness. Then he returned
      to his chair, and continued to look at it. &ldquo;I suppose that it resembles me
      a great deal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and yet I do not <i>feel</i> like that. I hardly
      know what is the fault. It is as I should be if I were like other priests,
      perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; said the painter. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> conventional, in
      spite of everything. But here&rsquo;s that first sketch I made of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up a canvas facing the wall, and set it on the easel. The
      character in this charcoal sketch was vastly sincerer and sweeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, with a sigh and smile of relief, &ldquo;that is
      immeasurably better. I wish I could speak to you, dear friend, in a mood
      of yours as sympathetic as this picture records, of some matters that
      concern me very nearly. I have just come from the railroad station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing some friends off?&rdquo; asked the painter, indifferently, hovering near
      the sketch with a bit of charcoal in his hand, and hesitating whether to
      give it a certain touch. He glanced with half-shut eyes at the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito sighed again. &ldquo;I hardly know. I was seeing off my hopes, my
      desires, my prayers, that followed the train to America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter put down his charcoal, dusted his fingers, and looked at the
      priest without saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember when I first came to you?&rdquo; asked Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Ferris. &ldquo;Is it of that matter you want to speak to me?
      I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear it, for I don&rsquo;t think it practical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practical, practical!&rdquo; cried the priest hotly. &ldquo;Nothing is practical till
      it has been tried. And why should I not go to America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t get your passport, for one thing,&rdquo; answered the painter
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; rejoined Don Ippolito more patiently. &ldquo;I can get
      a passport for France from the Austrian authorities here, and at Milan
      there must be ways in which I could change it for one from my own king&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was by this title that patriotic Venetians of those days spoke of Victor
      Emmanuel&mdash;&ldquo;that would carry me out of France into England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris pondered a moment. &ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why hadn&rsquo;t you
      thought of that when you first came to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell. I didn&rsquo;t know that I could even get a passport for France
      till the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent while the painter filled his pipe. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said
      presently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re dooming yourself to many
      bitter disappointments in going to America. What do you expect to do
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, with my inventions&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; interrupted the other, putting a lighted match to his pipe,
      &ldquo;that a painter must be a very poor sort of American: <i>his</i> first
      thought is of coming to Italy. So I know very little directly about the
      fortunes of my inventive fellow-countrymen, or whether an inventor has any
      prospect of making a living. But once when I was at Washington I went into
      the Patent Office, where the models of the inventions are deposited; the
      building is about as large as the Ducal Palace, and it is full of them.
      The people there told me nothing was commoner than for the same invention
      to be repeated over and over again by different inventors. Some few
      succeed, and then they have lawsuits with the infringers of their patents;
      some sell out their inventions for a trifle to companies that have
      capital, and that grow rich upon them; the great number can never bring
      their ideas to the public notice at all. You can judge for yourself what
      your chances would be. You have asked me why you should not go to America.
      Well, because I think you would starve there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am used to that,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito; &ldquo;and besides, until some of my
      inventions became known, I could give lessons in Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bravo!&rdquo; said Ferris, &ldquo;you prefer instant death, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But madamigella seemed to believe that my success as an inventor would be
      assured, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris gave a very ironical laugh. &ldquo;Miss Vervain must have been about
      twelve years old when she left America. Even a lady&rsquo;s knowledge of
      business, at that age, is limited. When did you talk with her about it?
      You had not spoken of it to me, of late, and I thought you were more
      contented than you used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Sometimes within the last two months I
      have almost forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has brought it so forcibly to your mind again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I so greatly desire to tell you,&rdquo; replied Don Ippolito, with
      an appealing look at the painter&rsquo;s face. He moistened his parched lips a
      little, waiting for further question from the painter, to whom he seemed a
      man fevered by some strong emotion and at that moment not quite wholesome.
      Ferris did not speak, and Don Ippolito began again: &ldquo;Even though I have
      not said so in words to you, dear friend, has it not appeared to you that
      I have no heart in my vocation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have sometimes fancied that. I had no right to ask you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I will tell you, when I have the courage to go all over it
      again. It is partly my own fault, but it is more my miserable fortune. But
      wherever the wrong lies, it has at last become intolerable to me. I cannot
      endure it any longer and live. I must go away, I must fly from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris shrank from him a little, as men instinctively do from one who has
      set himself upon some desperate attempt. &ldquo;Do you mean, Don Ippolito, that
      you are going to renounce your priesthood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito opened his hands and let his priesthood drop, as it were, to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never spoke of this before, when you talked of going to America.
      Though to be sure&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; replied Don Ippolito with vehemence, &ldquo;but now an angel has
      appeared and shown me the blackness of my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris began to wonder if he or Don Ippolito were not perhaps mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An angel, yes,&rdquo; the priest went on, rising from his chair, &ldquo;an angel
      whose immaculate truth has mirrored my falsehood in all its vileness and
      distortion&mdash;to whom, if it destroys me, I cannot devote less than a
      truthfulness like hers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hers&mdash;hers?&rdquo; cried the painter, with a sudden pang. &ldquo;Whose? Don&rsquo;t
      speak in these riddles. Whom do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom can I mean but only one?&mdash;madamigella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Vervain? Do you mean to say that Miss Vervain has advised you to
      renounce your priesthood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In as many words she has bidden me forsake it at any risk,&mdash;at the
      cost of kindred, friends, good fame, country, everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter passed his hand confusedly over his face. These were his own
      words, the words he had used in speaking with Florida of the supposed
      skeptical priest. He grew very pale. &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he demanded in a hard,
      dry voice, &ldquo;how she came to advise such a step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly tell. Something had already moved her to learn from me the
      story of my life&mdash;to know that I was a man with neither faith nor
      hope. Her pure heart was torn by the thought of my wrong and of my error.
      I had never seen myself in such deformity as she saw me even when she used
      me with that divine compassion. I was almost glad to be what I was because
      of her angelic pity for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears sprang to Don Ippolito&rsquo;s eyes, but Ferris asked in the same tone
      as before, &ldquo;Was it then that she bade you be no longer a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not then,&rdquo; patiently replied the other; &ldquo;she was too greatly
      overwhelmed with my calamity to think of any cure for it. To-day it was
      that she uttered those words&mdash;words which I shall never forget, which
      will support and comfort me, whatever happens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter was biting hard upon the stem of his pipe. He turned away and
      began ordering the color-tubes and pencils on a table against the wall,
      putting them close together in very neat, straight rows. Presently he
      said: &ldquo;Perhaps Miss Vervain also advised you to go to America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the priest reverently. &ldquo;She had thought of everything. She
      has promised me a refuge under her mother&rsquo;s roof there, until I can make
      my inventions known; and I shall follow them at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going, she told me. Madama does not grow better. They are
      homesick. They&mdash;but you must know all this already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all, not at all,&rdquo; said the painter with a very bitter smile.
      &ldquo;You are telling me news. Pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no more. She made me promise to come to you and listen to your
      advice before I took any step. I must not trust to her alone, she said;
      but if I took this step, then through whatever happened she would be my
      friend. Ah, dear friend, may I speak to you of the hope that these words
      gave me? You have seen&mdash;have you not?&mdash;you must have seen that&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest faltered, and Ferris stared at him helpless. When the next
      words came he could not find any strangeness in the fact which yet gave
      him so great a shock. He found that to his nether consciousness it had
      been long familiar&mdash;ever since that day when he had first jestingly
      proposed Don Ippolito as Miss Vervain&rsquo;s teacher. Grotesque, tragic,
      impossible&mdash;it had still been the under-current of all his reveries;
      or so now it seemed to have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito anxiously drew nearer to him and laid an imploring touch upon
      his arm,&mdash;&ldquo;I love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped the painter. &ldquo;You? You I A priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Priest! priest!&rdquo; cried Don Ippolito, violently. &ldquo;From this day I am no
      longer a priest! From this hour I am a man, and I can offer her the
      honorable love of a man, the truth of a most sacred marriage, and fidelity
      to death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris made no answer. He began to look very coldly and haughtily at Don
      Ippolito, whose heat died away under his stare, and who at last met it
      with a glance of tremulous perplexity. His hand had dropped from Ferris&rsquo;s
      arm, and he now moved some steps from him. &ldquo;What is it, dear friend?&rdquo; he
      besought him. &ldquo;Is there something that offends you? I came to you for
      counsel, and you meet me with a repulse little short of enmity. I do not
      understand. Do I intend anything wrong without knowing it? Oh, I conjure
      you to speak plainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Ferris, waving his hand like a man tormented
      by a passing pain. &ldquo;I am trying to think. What you say is.... I cannot
      imagine it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not imagine it? Not imagine it? And why? Is she not beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And young, and yet wise beyond her years? And true, and yet angelically
      kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all as you say, God knows. But.... a priest&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Always that accursed word! And at heart, what is a priest, then, but
      a man?&mdash;a wretched, masked, imprisoned, banished man! Has he not
      blood and nerves like you? Has he not eyes to see what is fair, and ears
      to hear what is sweet? Can he live near so divine a flower and not know
      her grace, not inhale the fragrance of her soul, not adore her beauty? Oh,
      great God! And if at last he would tear off his stifling mask, escape from
      his prison, return from his exile, would you gainsay him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the painter with a kind of groan. He sat down in a tall, carven
      gothic chair,&mdash;the furniture of one of his pictures,&mdash;and rested
      his head against its high back and looked at the priest across the room.
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he continued with a strong effort. &ldquo;I am ready to befriend
      you to the utmost of my power. What was it you wanted to ask me? I have
      told you truly what I thought of your scheme of going to America; but I
      may very well be mistaken. Was it about that Miss Vervain desired you to
      consult me?&rdquo; His voice and manner hardened again in spite of him. &ldquo;Or did
      she wish me to advise you about the renunciation of your priesthood? You
      must have thought that carefully over for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do not think you could make me see that as a greater difficulty
      than it has appeared to me.&rdquo; He paused with a confused and daunted air, as
      if some important point had slipped his mind. &ldquo;But I must take the step;
      the burden of the double part I play is unendurable, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know better than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you were such a man as I, with neither love for your vocation nor
      faith in it, should you not cease to be a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ask me in that way,&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered the painter. &ldquo;But I
      advise you nothing. I could not counsel another in such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you think and feel as I do,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and I am right, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say you are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris was silent while Don Ippolito moved up and down the room, with his
      sliding step, like some tall, gaunt, unhappy girl. Neither could put an
      end to this interview, so full of intangible, inconclusive misery. Ferris
      drew a long breath, and then said steadily, &ldquo;Don Ippolito, I suppose you
      did not speak idly to me of your&mdash;your feeling for Miss Vervain, and
      that I may speak plainly to you in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered the priest, pausing in his walk and fixing his eyes
      upon the painter. &ldquo;It was to you as the friend of both that I spoke of my
      love, and my hope&mdash;which is oftener my despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have not much reason to believe that she returns your&mdash;feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how could she consciously return it? I have been hitherto a priest to
      her, and the thought of me would have been impurity. But hereafter, if I
      can prove myself a man, if I can win my place in the world.... No, even
      now, why should she care so much for my escape from these bonds, if she
      did not care for me more than she knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever thought of that extravagant generosity of Miss Vervain&rsquo;s
      character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is divine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it seemed to you that if such a woman knew herself to have once
      wrongly given you pain, her atonement might be as headlong and excessive
      as her offense? That she could have no reserves in her reparation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito looked at Ferris, but did not interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Vervain is very religious in her way, and she is truth itself. Are
      you sure that it is not concern for what seems to her your terrible
      position, that has made her show so much anxiety on your account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know that well? Have I not felt the balm of her most heavenly
      pity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may she not be only trying to appeal to something in you as high as
      the impulse of her own heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As high!&rdquo; cried Don Ippolito, almost angrily. &ldquo;Can there be any higher
      thing in heaven or on earth than love for such a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; both in heaven and on earth,&rdquo; answered Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito with a puzzled stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris did not reply. He fell into a dull reverie in which he seemed to
      forget Don Ippolito and the whole affair. At last the priest spoke again:
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say to me, signore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? What is there to say?&rdquo; returned the other blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any reason why I should not love her, save that I am&mdash;have
      been&mdash;a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know none,&rdquo; said the painter, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Don Ippolito, &ldquo;there is something on your mind that you
      will not speak. I beseech you not to let me go wrong. I love her so well
      that I would rather die than let my love offend her. I am a man with the
      passions and hopes of a man, but without a man&rsquo;s experience, or a man&rsquo;s
      knowledge of what is just and right in these relations. If you can be my
      friend in this so far as to advise or warn me; if you can be her friend&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris abruptly rose and went to his balcony, and looked out upon the
      Grand Canal. The time-stained palace opposite had not changed in the last
      half-hour. As on many another summer day, he saw the black boats going by.
      A heavy, high-pointed barge from the Sile, with the captain&rsquo;s family at
      dinner in the shade of a matting on the roof, moved sluggishly down the
      middle current. A party of Americans in a gondola, with their
      opera-glasses and guide-books in their hands, pointed out to each other
      the eagle on the consular arms. They were all like sights in a mirror, or
      things in a world turned upside down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris came back and looked dizzily at the priest trying to believe that
      this unhuman, sacerdotal phantasm had been telling him that it loved a
      beautiful young girl of his own race, faith, and language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not answer me, signore?&rdquo; meekly demanded Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this matter,&rdquo; replied the painter, &ldquo;I cannot advise or warn you. The
      whole affair is beyond my conception. I mean no unkindness, but I cannot
      consult with you about it. There are reasons why I should not. The mother
      of Miss Vervain is here with her, and I do not feel that her interests in
      such a matter are in my hands. If they come to me for help, that is
      different. What do you wish? You tell me that you are resolved to renounce
      the priesthood and go to America; and I have answered you to the best of
      my power. You tell me that you are in love with Miss Vervain. What can I
      have to say about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito stood listening with a patient, and then a wounded air.
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered proudly. &ldquo;I ask your pardon for troubling you with
      my affairs. Your former kindness emboldened me too much. I shall not
      trespass again. It was my ignorance, which I pray you to excuse. I take my
      leave, signore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and moved out of the room, and a dull remorse filled the
      painter, as he heard the outer door close after him. But he could do
      nothing. If he had given a wound to the heart that trusted him, it was in
      an anguish which he had not been able to master, and whose causes he could
      not yet define. It was all a shapeless torment; it held him like the
      memory of some hideous nightmare prolonging its horror beyond sleep. It
      seemed impossible that what had happened should have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long, as he sat in the chair from which he had talked with Don
      Ippolito, before he could reason about what had been said; and then the
      worst phase presented itself first. He could not help seeing that the
      priest might have found cause for hope in the girl&rsquo;s behavior toward him.
      Her violent resentments, and her equally violent repentances; her fervent
      interest in his unhappy fortunes, and her anxiety that he should at once
      forsake the priesthood; her urging him to go to America, and her promising
      him a home under her mother&rsquo;s roof there: why might it not all be in fact
      a proof of her tenderness for him? She might have found it necessary to be
      thus coarsely explicit with him, for a man in Don Ippolito&rsquo;s relation to
      her could not otherwise have imagined her interest in him. But her making
      use of Ferris to confirm her own purposes by his words, her repeating them
      so that they should come back to him from Don Ippolito&rsquo;s lips, her letting
      another man go with her to look upon the procession in which her priestly
      lover was to appear in his sacerdotal panoply; these things could not be
      accounted for except by that strain of insolent, passionate defiance which
      he had noted ill her from the beginning. Why should she first tell Don
      Ippolito of their going away? &ldquo;Well, I wish him joy of his bargain,&rdquo; said
      Ferris aloud, and rising, shrugged his shoulders, and tried to cast off
      all care of a matter that did not concern him. But one does not so easily
      cast off a matter that does not concern one. He found himself haunted by
      certain tones and looks and attitudes of the young girl, wholly alien to
      the character he had just constructed for her. They were child-like,
      trusting, unconscious, far beyond anything he had yet known in women, and
      they appealed to him now with a maddening pathos. She was standing there
      before Don Ippolito&rsquo;s picture as on that morning when she came to Ferris,
      looking anxiously at him, her innocent beauty, troubled with some hidden
      care, hallowing the place. Ferris thought of the young fellow who told him
      that he had spent three months in a dull German town because he had the
      room there that was once occupied by the girl who had refused him; the
      painter remembered that the young fellow said he had just read of her
      marriage in an American newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did Miss Vervain send Don Ippolito to him? Was it some scheme of her
      secret love for the priest; or mere coarse resentment of the cautions
      Ferris had once hinted, a piece of vulgar bravado? But if she had acted
      throughout in pure simplicity, in unwise goodness of heart? If Don
      Ippolito were altogether self-deceived, and nothing but her unknowing pity
      had given him grounds of hope? He himself had suggested this to the
      priest, and how with a different motive he looked at it in his own behalf.
      A great load began slowly to lift itself from Ferris&rsquo;s heart, which could
      ache now for this most unhappy priest. But if his conjecture were just,
      his duty would be different. He must not coldly acquiesce and let things
      take their course. He had introduced Don Ippolito to the Vervains; he was
      in some sort responsible for him; he must save them if possible from the
      painful consequences of the priest&rsquo;s hallucination. But how to do this was
      by no means clear. He blamed himself for not having been franker with Don
      Ippolito and tried to make him see that the Vervains might regard his
      passion as a presumption upon their kindness to him, an abuse of their
      hospitable friendship; and yet how could he have done this without outrage
      to a sensitive and right-meaning soul? For a moment it seemed to him that
      he must seek Don Ippolito, and repair his fault; but they had hardly
      parted as friends, and his action might be easily misconstrued. If he
      shrank from the thought of speaking to him of the matter again, it
      appeared yet more impossible to bring it before the Vervains. Like a man
      of the imaginative temperament as he was, he exaggerated the probable
      effect, and pictured their dismay in colors that made his interference
      seem a ludicrous enormity; in fact, it would have been an awkward business
      enough for one not hampered by his intricate obligations. He felt bound to
      the Vervains, the ignorant young girl, and the addle-pated mother; but if
      he ought to go to them and tell them what he knew, to which of them ought
      he to speak, and how? In an anguish of perplexity that made the sweat
      stand in drops upon his forehead, he smiled to think it just possible that
      Mrs. Vervain might take the matter seriously, and wish to consider the
      propriety of Florida&rsquo;s accepting Don Ippolito. But if he spoke to the
      daughter, how should he approach the subject? &ldquo;Don Ippolito tells me he
      loves you, and he goes to America with the expectation that when he has
      made his fortune with a patent back-action apple-corer, you will marry
      him.&rdquo; Should he say something to this purport? And in Heaven&rsquo;s name what
      right had he, Ferris, to say anything at all? The horrible absurdity, the
      inexorable delicacy of his position made him laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, besides, he was bound to Don Ippolito, who had come to
      him as the nearest friend of both, and confided in him. He remembered with
      a tardy, poignant intelligence how in their first talk of the Vervains Don
      Ippolito had taken pains to inform himself that Ferris was not in love
      with Florida. Could he be less manly and generous than this poor priest,
      and violate the sanctity of his confidence? Ferris groaned aloud. No,
      contrive it as he would, call it by what fair name he chose, he could not
      commit this treachery. It was the more impossible to him because, in this
      agony of doubt as to what he should do, he now at least read his own heart
      clearly, and had no longer a doubt what was in it. He pitied her for the
      pain she must suffer. He saw how her simple goodness, her blind sympathy
      with Don Ippolito, and only this, must have led the priest to the mistaken
      pass at which he stood. But Ferris felt that the whole affair had been
      fatally carried beyond his reach; he could do nothing now but wait and
      endure. There are cases in which a man must not protect the woman he
      loves. This was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon wore away. In the evening he went to the Piazza, and drank a
      cup of coffee at Florian&rsquo;s. Then he walked to the Public Gardens, where he
      watched the crowd till it thinned in the twilight and left him alone. He
      hung upon the parapet, looking off over the lagoon that at last he
      perceived to be flooded with moonlight. He desperately called a gondola,
      and bade the man row him to the public landing nearest the Vervains&rsquo;, and
      so walked up the calle, and entered the palace from the campo, through the
      court that on one side opened into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain was alone in the room where he had always been accustomed to
      find her daughter with her, and a chill as of the impending change fell
      upon him. He felt how pleasant it had been to find them together; with a
      vain, piercing regret he felt how much like home the place had been to
      him. Mrs. Vervain, indeed, was not changed; she was even more than ever
      herself, though all that she said imported change. She seemed to observe
      nothing unwonted in him, and she began to talk in her way of things that
      she could not know were so near his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Ferris, I have a little surprise for you. Guess what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good at guessing. I&rsquo;d rather not know what it is than have to
      guess it,&rdquo; said Ferris, trying to be light, under his heavy trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t try once, even? Well, you&rsquo;re going to be rid of us soon I We
      are going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew that,&rdquo; said Ferris quietly. &ldquo;Don Ippolito told me so to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that all you have to say? Isn&rsquo;t it rather sad? Isn&rsquo;t it sudden?
      Come, Mr. Ferris, do be a little complimentary, for once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sudden, and I can assure you it&rsquo;s sad enough for me,&rdquo; replied the
      painter, in a tone which could not leave any doubt of his sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so it is for us,&rdquo; quavered Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;You have been very, very
      good to us,&rdquo; she went on more collectedly, &ldquo;and we shall never forget it.
      Florida has been speaking of it, too, and she&rsquo;s extremely grateful, and
      thinks we&rsquo;ve quite imposed upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we have, but as I always say, you&rsquo;re the representative of the
      country here. However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. We have no relatives
      on the face of the earth, you know; but I have a good many old friends in
      Providence, and we&rsquo;re going back there. We both think I shall be better at
      home; for I&rsquo;m sorry to say, Mr. Ferns, that though I don&rsquo;t complain of
      Venice,&mdash;it&rsquo;s really a beautiful place, and all that; not the least
      exaggerated,&mdash;still I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s done my health much good; or
      at least I don&rsquo;t seem to gain, don&rsquo;t you know, I don&rsquo;t seem to gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear it, Mrs. Vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you are; but you see, don&rsquo;t you, that we must go? We are
      going next week. When we&rsquo;ve once made up our minds, there&rsquo;s no object in
      prolonging the agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain adjusted her glasses with the thumb and finger of her right
      hand, and peered into Ferris&rsquo;s face with a gay smile. &ldquo;But the greatest
      part of the surprise is,&rdquo; she resumed, lowering her voice a little, &ldquo;that
      Don Ippolito is going with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Ferris sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> I should surprise you,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
      having a regular confab&mdash;<i>clave</i>, I mean&mdash;about it here,
      and he&rsquo;s all on fire to go to America; though it must be kept a great
      secret on his account, poor fellow. He&rsquo;s to join us in France, and then he
      can easily get into England, with us. You know he&rsquo;s to give up being a
      priest, and is going to devote himself to invention when he gets to
      America. Now, what <i>do</i> you think of it, Mr. Ferris? Quite strikes
      you dumb, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; triumphed Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s what you
      would call a wild goose chase,&mdash;I used to pick up all those phrases,&mdash;but
      we shall carry it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris gasped, as though about to speak, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito&rsquo;s been here the whole afternoon,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Vervain,
      &ldquo;or rather ever since about five o&rsquo;clock. He took dinner with us, and
      we&rsquo;ve been talking it over and over. He&rsquo;s <i>so</i> enthusiastic about it,
      and yet he breaks down every little while, and seems quite to despair of
      the undertaking. But Florida won&rsquo;t let him do that; and really it&rsquo;s funny,
      the way he defers to her judgment&mdash;you know <i>I</i> always regard
      Florida as such a mere child&mdash;and seems to take every word she says
      for gospel. But, shedding tears, now: it&rsquo;s dreadful in a man, isn&rsquo;t it? I
      wish Don Ippolito wouldn&rsquo;t do that. It makes one creep. I can&rsquo;t feel that
      it&rsquo;s manly; can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris found voice to say something about those things being different
      with the Latin races.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that <i>Americans</i>
      don&rsquo;t shed tears, as a general <i>rule</i>. Now, Florida: you&rsquo;d think she
      was the man all through this business, she&rsquo;s so perfectly heroic about it;
      that is, outwardly: for I can see&mdash;women can, in each other, Mr.
      Ferris&mdash;just where she&rsquo;s on the point of breaking down, all the
      while. Has she ever spoken to you about Don Ippolito? She does think so
      highly of your opinion, Mr. Ferris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does me too much honor,&rdquo; said Ferris, with ghastly irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Vervain. &ldquo;She told me this morning
      that she&rsquo;d made Don Ippolito promise to speak to you about it; but he
      didn&rsquo;t mention having done so, and&mdash;I hated, don&rsquo;t you know, to ask
      him.... In fact, Florida had told me beforehand that I mustn&rsquo;t. She said
      he must be left entirely to himself in that matter, and&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
      Vervain looked suggestively at Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke to me about it,&rdquo; said Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why in the world did you let me run on? I suppose you advised him
      against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s where I think woman&rsquo;s intuition is better than man&rsquo;s
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter silently bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m quite woman&rsquo;s rights in that respect,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, without doubt,&rdquo; answered Ferris, aimlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly delighted,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;at the idea of Don Ippolito&rsquo;s
      giving up the priesthood, and I&rsquo;ve told him he must get married to some
      good American girl. You ought to have seen how the poor fellow blushed!
      But really, you know, there are lots of nice girls that would <i>jump</i>
      at him&mdash;so handsome and sad-looking, and a genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris could only stare helplessly at Mrs. Vervain, who continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he&rsquo;s a genius, and I&rsquo;m determined that he shall have a
      chance. I suppose we&rsquo;ve got a job on our hands; but I&rsquo;m not sorry. I&rsquo;ll
      introduce him into society, and if he needs money he shall have it. What
      does God give us money for, Mr. Ferris, but to help our fellow-creatures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So miserable, as he was, from head to foot, that it seemed impossible he
      could endure more, Ferris could not forbear laughing at this burst of
      piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vervain, who had cheerfully joined
      him. &ldquo;Something I&rsquo;ve been saying. Well, you won&rsquo;t have me to laugh at much
      longer. I do wonder whom you&rsquo;ll have next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris&rsquo;s merriment died away in something like a groan, and when Mrs.
      Vervain again spoke, it was in a tone of sudden querulousness. &ldquo;I <i>wish</i>
      Florida would come! She went to bolt the land-gate after Don Ippolito,&mdash;I
      wanted her to,&mdash;but she ought to have been back long ago. It&rsquo;s odd
      you didn&rsquo;t meet them, coming in. She must be in the garden somewhere; I
      suppose she&rsquo;s sorry to be leaving it. But I need her. Would you be so very
      kind, Mr. Ferris, as to go and ask her to come to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris rose heavily from the chair in which he seemed to have grown ten
      years older. He had hardly heard anything that he did not know already,
      but the clear vision of the affair with which he had come to the Vervains
      was hopelessly confused and darkened. He could make nothing of any phase
      of it. He did not know whether he cared now to see Florida or not. He
      mechanically obeyed Mrs. Vervain, and stepping out upon the terrace,
      slowly descended the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was shining brightly into the garden.

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Florida and Don Ippolito had paused in the pathway which parted at the
      fountain and led in one direction to the water-gate, and in the other out
      through the palace-court into the campo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you must not give way to despair again,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;You will
      succeed, I am sure, for you will deserve success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all your goodness, madamigella,&rdquo; sighed the priest, &ldquo;and at the
      bottom of my heart I am afraid that all the hope and courage I have are
      also yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall never want for hope and courage then. We believe in you, and we
      honor your purpose, and we will be your steadfast friends. But now you
      must think only of the present&mdash;of how you are to get away from
      Venice. Oh, I can understand how you must hate to leave it! What a
      beautiful night! You mustn&rsquo;t expect such moonlight as this in America, Don
      Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> beautiful, is it not?&rdquo; said the priest, kindling from her.
      &ldquo;But I think we Venetians are never so conscious of the beauty of Venice
      as you strangers are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I only know that now, since we have made up our minds to
      go, and fixed the day and hour, it is more like leaving my own country
      than anything else I&rsquo;ve ever felt. This garden, I seem to have spent my
      whole life in it; and when we are settled in Providence, I&rsquo;m going to have
      mother send back for some of these statues. I suppose Signor Cavaletti
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind our robbing his place of them if he were paid enough. At any
      rate we must have this one that belongs to the fountain. You shall be the
      first to set the fountain playing over there, Don Ippolito, and then we&rsquo;ll
      sit down on this stone bench before it, and imagine ourselves in the
      garden of Casa Vervain at Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; let me be the last to set it playing here,&rdquo; said the priest,
      quickly stooping to the pipe at the foot of the figure, &ldquo;and then we will
      sit down here, and imagine ourselves in the garden of Casa Vervain at
      Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida put her hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she said
      simply. &ldquo;The padrone doesn&rsquo;t like to waste the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll pray the saints to rain it back on him some day,&rdquo; cried Don
      Ippolito with willful levity, and the stream leaped into the moonlight and
      seemed to hang there like a tangled skein of silver. &ldquo;But how shall I shut
      it off when you are gone?&rdquo; asked the young girl, looking ruefully at the
      floating threads of splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will shut it off before I go,&rdquo; answered Don Ippolito. &ldquo;Let it play
      a moment,&rdquo; he continued, gazing rapturously upon it, while the moon
      painted his lifted face with a pallor that his black robes heightened. He
      fetched a long, sighing breath, as if he inhaled with that respiration all
      the rich odors of the flowers, blanched like his own visage in the white
      lustre; as if he absorbed into his heart at once the wide glory of the
      summer night, and the beauty of the young girl at his side. It seemed a
      supreme moment with him; he looked as a man might look who has climbed out
      of lifelong defeat into a single instant of release and triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida sank upon the bench before the fountain, indulging his caprice
      with that sacred, motherly tolerance, some touch of which is in all
      womanly yielding to men&rsquo;s will, and which was perhaps present in greater
      degree in her feeling towards a man more than ordinarily orphaned and
      unfriended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Providence your native city?&rdquo; asked Don Ippolito, abruptly, after a
      little silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I was born at St. Augustine in Florida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, I forgot; madama has told me about it; Providence is <i>her</i>
      city. But the two are near together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Florida, compassionately, &ldquo;they are a thousand miles apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand miles? What a vast country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a whole world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, a world, indeed!&rdquo; cried the priest, softly. &ldquo;I shall never comprehend
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will,&rdquo; answered the young girl gravely, &ldquo;if you do not think
      about it more practically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically, practically!&rdquo; lightly retorted the priest. &ldquo;What a word with
      you Americans; That is the consul&rsquo;s word: <i>practical</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have been to see him to-day?&rdquo; asked Florida, with eagerness. &ldquo;I
      wanted to ask you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went to consult the oracle, as you bade me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was averse to my going to America. He said it was not practical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; continued the priest with vehemence, &ldquo;that Signor Ferris is no
      longer my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he treat you coldly&mdash;harshly?&rdquo; she asked, with a note of
      indignation in her voice. &ldquo;Did he know that I&mdash;that you came&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he was right. Perhaps I shall indeed go to ruin there. Ruin,
      ruin! Do I not <i>live</i> ruin here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say&mdash;what did he tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not now, madamigella! I do not want to think of that man, now. I
      want you to help me once more to realize myself in America, where I shall
      never have been a priest, where I shall at least battle even-handed with
      the world. Come, let us forget him; the thought of him palsies all my
      hope. He could not see me save in this robe, in this figure that I abhor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was strange, it was not like him, it was cruel! What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In everything but words, he bade me despair; he bade me look upon all
      that makes life dear and noble as impossible to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how? Perhaps he did not understand you. No, he did not understand
      you. What did you say to him, Don Ippolito? Tell me!&rdquo; She leaned towards
      him, in anxious emotion, as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest rose, and stretched out his arms, as if he would gather
      something of courage from the infinite space. In his visage were the
      sublimity and the terror of a man who puts everything to the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will it really be with me, yonder?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;As it is with other
      men, whom their past life, if it has been guiltless, does not follow to
      that new world of freedom and justice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it not be so?&rdquo; demanded Florida. &ldquo;Did <i>he</i> say it would
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need it be known there that I have been a priest? Or if I tell it, will
      it make me appear a kind of monster, different from other men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she answered fervently. &ldquo;Your story would gain friends and honor
      for you everywhere in America. Did <i>he</i>&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment, a moment!&rdquo; cried Don Ippolito, catching his breath. &ldquo;Will it
      ever be possible for me to win something more than honor and friendship
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him askingly, confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am a man, and the time should ever come that a face, a look, a
      voice, shall be to me what they are to other men, will <i>she</i> remember
      it against me that I have been a priest, when I tell her&mdash;say to her,
      madamigella&mdash;how dear she is to me, offer her my life&rsquo;s devotion, ask
      her to be my wife?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Florida rose from the seat, and stood confronting him, in a helpless
      silence, which he seemed not to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he clasped his hands together, and desperately stretched them
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my hope, my trust, my life, if it were you that I loved?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; shuddered the girl, recoiling, with almost a shriek. &ldquo;<i>You</i>?
      <i>A priest</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito gave a low cry, half sob:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His words, his words! It is true, I cannot escape, I am doomed, I must
      die as I have lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his face into his hands, and stood with his head bowed before
      her; neither spoke for a long time, or moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Florida said absently, in the husky murmur to which her voice fell
      when she was strongly moved, &ldquo;Yes, I see it all, how it has been,&rdquo; and was
      silent again, staring, as if a procession of the events and scenes of the
      past months were passing before her; and presently she moaned to herself
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; and wrung her hands. The foolish fountain kept capering and
      babbling on. All at once, now, as a flame flashes up and then expires, it
      leaped and dropped extinct at the foot of the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its going out seemed somehow to leave them in darkness, and under cover of
      that gloom she drew nearer the priest, and by such approaches as one makes
      toward a fancied apparition, when his fear will not let him fly, but it
      seems better to suffer the worst from it at once than to live in terror of
      it ever after, she lifted her hands to his, and gently taking them away
      from his face, looked into his hopeless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Don Ippolito,&rdquo; she grieved. &ldquo;What shall I say to you, what can I do
      for you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was nothing to do. The whole edifice of his dreams, his wild
      imaginations, had fallen into dust at a word; no magic could rebuild it;
      the end that never seems the end had come. He let her keep his cold hands,
      and presently he returned the entreaty of her tears with his wan, patient
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot help me; there is no help for an error like mine. Sometime, if
      ever the thought of me is a greater pain than it is at this moment, you
      can forgive me. Yes, you can do that for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who, <i>who</i> will ever forgive me&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;for my blindness!
      Oh, you must believe that I never thought, I never dreamt&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well. It was your fatal truth that did it; truth too high and
      fine for me to have discerned save through such agony as.... You too loved
      my soul, like the rest, and you would have had me no priest for the reason
      that they would have had me a priest&mdash;I see it. But you had no right
      to love my soul and not me&mdash;you, a woman. A woman must not love only
      the soul of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; piteously explained the girl, &ldquo;but you were a priest to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, madamigella. I was always a priest to you; and now I see
      that I never could be otherwise. Ah, the wrong began many years before we
      met. I was trying to blame you a little&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame me, blame me; do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;but there is no blame. Think that it was another way of asking
      your forgiveness.... O my God, my God, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released his hands from her, and uttered this cry under his breath,
      with his face lifted towards the heavens. When he looked at her again, he
      said: &ldquo;Madamigella, if my share of this misery gives me the right to ask
      of you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ask anything of me! I will give everything, do everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faltered, and then, &ldquo;You do not love me,&rdquo; he said abruptly; &ldquo;is there
      some one else that you love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it ... he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hid her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; groaned the priest, &ldquo;I knew that too!&rdquo; and he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Ippolito, Don Ippolito&mdash;oh, poor, poor Don Ippolito!&rdquo; cried the
      girl, springing towards him. &ldquo;Is <i>this</i> the way you leave me? Where
      are you going? What will you do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not say? I am going to die a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing that you will let me be to you, hope for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito, after a moment. &ldquo;What could you?&rdquo; He seized
      the hands imploringly extended towards him, and clasped them together and
      kissed them both. &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; he whispered; then he opened them, and
      passionately kissed either palm; &ldquo;adieu, adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great wave of sorrow and compassion and despair for him swept through
      her. She flung her arms about his neck, and pulled his head down upon her
      heart, and held it tight there, weeping and moaning over him as over some
      hapless, harmless thing that she had unpurposely bruised or killed. Then
      she suddenly put her hands against his breast, and thrust him away, and
      turned and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris stepped back again into the shadow of the tree from which he had
      just emerged, and clung to its trunk lest he should fall. Another seemed
      to creep out of the court in his person, and totter across the white glare
      of the campo and down the blackness of the calle. In the intersected
      spaces where the moonlight fell, this alien, miserable man saw the figure
      of a priest gliding on before him.

    <h2>
      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Florida swiftly mounted the terrace steps, but she stopped with her hand
      on the door, panting, and turned and walked slowly away to the end of the
      terrace, drying her eyes with dashes of her handkerchief, and ordering her
      hair, some coils of which had been loosened by her flight. Then she went
      back to the door, waited, and softly opened it. Her mother was not in the
      parlor where she had left her, and she passed noiselessly into her own
      room, where some trunks stood open and half-packed against the wall. She
      began to gather up the pieces of dress that lay upon the bed and chairs,
      and to fold them with mechanical carefulness and put them in the boxes.
      Her mother&rsquo;s voice called from the other chamber, &ldquo;Is that you, Florida?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; answered the girl, but remained kneeling before one of the
      boxes, with that pale green robe in her hand which she had worn on the
      morning when Ferris had first brought Don Ippolito to see them. She
      smoothed its folds and looked down at it without making any motion to pack
      it away, and so she lingered while her mother advanced with one question
      after another; &ldquo;What are you doing, Florida? Where are you? Why didn&rsquo;t you
      come to me?&rdquo; and finally stood in the doorway. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re packing. Do you
      know, Florida, I&rsquo;m getting very impatient about going. I wish we could be
      off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremor passed over the young girl and she started from her languid
      posture, and laid the dress in the trunk. &ldquo;So do I, mother. I would give
      the world if we could go to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we can&rsquo;t, you see. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve undertaken a great deal, my
      dear. It&rsquo;s quite a weight upon <i>my</i> mind, already; and I don&rsquo;t know
      what it <i>will</i> be. If we were free, now, I should say, go to-morrow,
      by all means. But we couldn&rsquo;t arrange it with Don Ippolito on our hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida waited a moment before she replied. Then she said coldly, &ldquo;Don
      Ippolito is not going with us, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going with us? Why&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not going to America. He will not leave Venice; he is to remain a
      priest,&rdquo; said Florida, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain sat down in the chair that stood beside the door. &ldquo;Not going
      to America; not leave Venice; remain a priest? Florida, you astonish me!
      But I am not the least surprised, not the least in the world. I thought
      Don Ippolito would give out, all along. He is not what I should call
      fickle, exactly, but he is weak, or timid, rather. He is a good man, but
      he lacks courage, resolution. I always doubted if he would succeed in
      America; he is too much of a dreamer. But this, really, goes a little
      beyond anything. I never expected this. What did he say, Florida? How did
      he excuse himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know; very little. What was there to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, to be sure. Did you try to reason with him, Florida?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl, drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that. I think you had said quite enough already. You owed it
      to yourself not to do so, and he might have misinterpreted it. These
      foreigners are very different from Americans. No doubt we should have had
      a time of it, if he had gone with us. It must be for the best. I&rsquo;m sure it
      was ordered so. But all that doesn&rsquo;t relieve Don Ippolito from the charge
      of black ingratitude, and want of consideration for us. He&rsquo;s quite made
      fools of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not to blame. It was a very great step for him. And if&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. But he ought not to have talked of it. He ought to have
      known his own mind fully before speaking; that&rsquo;s the only safe way. Well,
      then, there is nothing to prevent our going to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida drew a long breath, and rose to go on with the work of packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been crying, Florida? Well, of course, you can&rsquo;t help feeling
      sorry for such a man. There&rsquo;s a great deal of good in Don Ippolito, a
      great deal. But when you come to my age you won&rsquo;t cry so easily, my dear.
      It&rsquo;s very trying,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain. She sat awhile in silence before she
      asked: &ldquo;Will he come here to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter looked at her with a glance of terrified inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do have your wits about you, my dear! We can&rsquo;t go away without saying
      good-by to him, and we can&rsquo;t go away without paying him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paying him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, paying him&mdash;paying him for your lessons. It&rsquo;s always been very
      awkward. He hasn&rsquo;t been like other teachers, you know: more like a guest,
      or friend of the family. He never seemed to want to take the money, and of
      late, I&rsquo;ve been letting it run along, because I hated so to offer it, till
      now, it&rsquo;s quite a sum. I suppose he needs it, poor fellow. And how to get
      it to him is the question. He may not come to-morrow, as usual, and I
      couldn&rsquo;t trust it to the padrone. We might send it to him in a draft from
      Paris, but I&rsquo;d rather pay him before we go. Besides, it would be rather
      rude, going away without seeing him again.&rdquo; Mrs. Vervain thought a moment;
      then, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t happen to come here
      to-morrow morning, we can stop on our way to the station and give him the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that would be a good plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the girl in a dull way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Florida, if you think from anything Don Ippolito said that he would
      rather not see us again&mdash;that it would be painful to him&mdash;why,
      we could ask Mr. Ferris to hand him the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no, no, mother!&rdquo; cried Florida, hiding her face, &ldquo;that would be
      too horribly indelicate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite good taste,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain
      perturbedly, &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t express yourself so violently, my dear. It&rsquo;s
      not a matter of life and death. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to do. We must
      stop at Don Ippolito&rsquo;s house, I suppose. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; faintly assented the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain yawned. &ldquo;Well I can&rsquo;t think anything more about it to-night;
      I&rsquo;m too stupid. But that&rsquo;s the way we shall do. Will you help me to bed,
      my dear? I shall be good for nothing to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on talking of Don Ippolito&rsquo;s change of purpose till her head
      touched the pillow, from which she suddenly lifted it again, and called
      out to her daughter, who had passed into the next room: &ldquo;But Mr. Ferris&mdash;&mdash;why
      didn&rsquo;t he come back with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, child. I sent him out to call you, just before you came in. This
      Don Ippolito business put him quite out of my head. Didn&rsquo;t you see him?
      ... Oh! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing: I dropped my candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you didn&rsquo;t set anything on fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! It went dead out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light it again, and do look. Now is everything right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer he didn&rsquo;t come back to <i>say</i> he couldn&rsquo;t find you. What
      do you suppose became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very perplexing. I wish Mr. Ferris were not so odd. It quite borders
      on affectation. I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it. We must send word to him
      the very first thing to-morrow morning, that we&rsquo;re going, and ask him to
      come to see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida made no reply. She sat staring at the black space of the doorway
      into her mother&rsquo;s room. Mrs. Vervain did not speak again. After a while
      her daughter softly entered her chamber, shading the candle with her hand;
      and seeing that she slept, softly withdrew, closed the door, and went
      about the work of packing again. When it was all done, she flung herself
      upon her bed and hid her face in the pillow.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The next morning was spent in bestowing those interminable last touches
      which the packing of ladies&rsquo; baggage demands, and in taking leave with
      largess (in which Mrs. Vervain shone) of all the people in the house and
      out of it, who had so much as touched a hat to the Vervains during their
      sojourn. The whole was not a vast sum; nor did the sundry extortions of
      the padrone come to much, though the honest man racked his brain to invent
      injuries to his apartments and furniture. Being unmurmuringly paid, he
      gave way to his real goodwill for his tenants in many little useful
      offices. At the end he persisted in sending them to the station in his own
      gondola and could with difficulty be kept from going with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain had early sent a message to Ferris, but word came back a
      first and a second time that he was not at home, and the forenoon wore
      away and he had not appeared. A certain indignation sustained her till the
      gondola pushed out into the canal, and then it yielded to an intolerable
      regret that she should not see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> go without saying good-by to Mr. Ferris, Florida,&rdquo; she
      said at last, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s no use asking me. He may have been wanting a
      little in politeness, but he&rsquo;s been <i>so</i> good all along; and we owe
      him too much not to make an effort to thank him before we go. We really
      must stop a moment at his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida, who had regarded her mother&rsquo;s efforts to summon Ferris to them
      with passive coldness, turned a look of agony upon her. But in a moment
      she bade the gondolier stop at the consulate, and dropping her veil over
      her face, fell back in the shadow of the tenda-curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain sentimentalized their departure a little, but her daughter
      made no comment on the scene they were leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondolier rang at Ferris&rsquo;s door and returned with the answer that he
      was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain gave way to despair. &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear! This is too bad! What
      shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose the train, mother, if we loiter in this way,&rdquo; said Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait. I <i>must</i> leave a message at least.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>How could you be
      away</i>,&rdquo; she wrote on her card, &ldquo;<i>when we called to say good-by? We&rsquo;ve
      changed our plans and we&rsquo;re going to-day. I shall write you a nice
      scolding letter from Verona&mdash;we&rsquo;re going over the Brenner&mdash;for
      your behavior last night. Who will keep you straight when I&rsquo;m gone? You&rsquo;ve
      been very, very kind. Florida joins me in a thousand thanks, regrets, and
      good-byes.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I haven&rsquo;t said anything, after all,&rdquo; she fretted, with tears in
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondolier carried the card again to the door, where Ferris&rsquo;s servant
      let down a basket by a string and fished it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Don Ippolito shouldn&rsquo;t be in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, as the boat moved on
      again, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I <i>shall</i> do with this money. It will be
      awkward beyond anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gondola slipped from the Canalazzo into the network of the smaller
      canals, where the dense shadows were as old as the palaces that cast them
      and stopped at the landing of a narrow quay. The gondolier dismounted and
      rang at Don Ippolito&rsquo;s door. There was no response; he rang again and
      again. At last from a window of the uppermost story the head of the priest
      himself peered out. The gondolier touched his hat and said, &ldquo;It is the
      ladies who ask for you, Don Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a minute before the door opened, and the priest, bare-headed and
      blinking in the strong light, came with a stupefied air across the quay to
      the landing-steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Don Ippolito!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vervain, rising and giving him her hand,
      which she first waved at the trunks and bags piled up in the vacant space
      in the front of the boat, &ldquo;what do you think of this? We are really going,
      immediately; <i>we</i> can change our minds too; and I don&rsquo;t think it
      would have been too much,&rdquo; she added with a friendly smile, &ldquo;if we had
      gone without saying good-by to you. What in the world does it all mean,
      your giving up that grand project of yours so suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down again, that she might talk more at her ease, and seemed
      thoroughly happy to have Don Ippolito before her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It finally appeared best, madama,&rdquo; he said quietly, after a quick, keen
      glance at Florida, who did not lift her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;re partly right. But I can&rsquo;t help thinking that you
      with your talent would have succeeded in America. Inventors do get on
      there, in the most surprising way. There&rsquo;s the Screw Company of
      Providence. It&rsquo;s such a simple thing; and now the shares are worth eight
      hundred. Are you well to-day, Don Ippolito?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, madama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you looked rather pale. But I believe you&rsquo;re always a little
      pale. You mustn&rsquo;t work too hard. We shall miss you a great deal, Don
      Ippolito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, madama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we shall be quite lost without you. And I wanted to say this to you,
      Don Ippolito, that if ever you change your mind again, and conclude to
      come to America, you must write to me, and let me help you just as I had
      intended to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest shivered, as if cold, and gave another look at Florida&rsquo;s veiled
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I really think I am,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Vervain, playfully. &ldquo;Considering
      that you were going to let me leave Venice without even trying to say
      good-by to me, I think I&rsquo;m very good indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s mood became overcast, and her eyes filled with tears: &ldquo;I
      hope you&rsquo;re sorry to have us going, Don Ippolito, for you know how very
      highly I prize your acquaintance. It was rather cruel of you, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed not to remember that he could not have known of their change of
      plan. Don Ippolito looked imploringly into her face, and made a touching
      gesture of deprecation, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really afraid you&rsquo;re <i>not</i> well, and I think it&rsquo;s too bad of us
      to be going,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Vervain; &ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be helped now: we are
      all packed, don&rsquo;t you see. But I want to ask one favor of you, Don
      Ippolito; and that is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vervain, covertly taking a little <i>rouleau</i>
      from her pocket, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll leave these inventions of yours for a while,
      and give yourself a vacation. You need rest of mind. Go into the country,
      somewhere, do. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s preying upon you. But we must really be off,
      now. Shake hands with Florida&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to be the last to part with
      you,&rdquo; she said, with a tearful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito and Florida extended their hands. Neither spoke, and as she
      sank back upon the seat from which she had half risen, she drew more
      closely the folds of the veil which she had not lifted from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vervain gave a little sob as Don Ippolito took her hand and kissed
      it; and she had some difficulty in leaving with him the rouleau, which she
      tried artfully to press into his palm. &ldquo;Good-by, good-by,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t drop it,&rdquo; and attempted to close his fingers over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he let it lie carelessly in his open hand, as the gondola moved off,
      and there it still lay as he stood watching the boat slip under a bridge
      at the next corner, and disappear. While he stood there gazing at the
      empty arch, a man of a wild and savage aspect approached. It was said that
      this man&rsquo;s brain had been turned by the death of his brother, who was
      betrayed to the Austrians after the revolution of &lsquo;48, by his wife&rsquo;s
      confessor. He advanced with swift strides, and at the moment he reached
      Don Ippolito&rsquo;s side he suddenly turned his face upon him and cursed him
      through his clenched teeth: &ldquo;Dog of a priest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Ippolito, as if his whole race had renounced him in the maniac&rsquo;s
      words, uttered a desolate cry, and hiding his face in his hands, tottered
      into his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rouleau had dropped from his palm; it rolled down the shelving marble
      of the quay, and slipped into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young beggar who had held Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s gondola to the shore while
      she talked, looked up and down the deserted quay, and at the doors and
      windows. Then he began to take off his clothes for a bath.

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ferris returned at nightfall to his house, where he had not been since
      daybreak, and flung himself exhausted upon the bed. His face was burnt red
      with the sun, and his eyes were bloodshot. He fell into a doze and dreamed
      that he was still at Malamocco, whither he had gone that morning in a sort
      of craze, with some fishermen, who were to cast their nets there; then he
      was rowing back to Venice across the lagoon, that seemed a molten fire
      under the keel. He woke with a heavy groan, and bade Marina fetch him a
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set it on the table, and handed him the card Mrs. Vervain had left. He
      read it and read it again, and then he laid it down, and putting on his
      hat, he took his cane and went out. &ldquo;Do not wait for me, Marina,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I may be late. Go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned at midnight, and lighting his candle took up the card and read
      it once more. He could not tell whether to be glad or sorry that he had
      failed to see the Vervains again. He took it for granted that Don Ippolito
      was to follow; he would not ask himself what motive had hastened their
      going. The reasons were all that he should never more look upon the woman
      so hatefully lost to him, but a strong instinct of his heart struggled
      against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay down in his clothes, and began to dream almost before he began to
      sleep. He woke early, and went out to walk. He did not rest all day. Once
      he came home, and found a letter from Mrs. Vervain, postmarked Verona,
      reiterating her lamentations and adieux, and explaining that the priest
      had relinquished his purpose, and would not go to America at all. The
      deeper mystery in which this news left him was not less sinister than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the weeks that followed, Ferris had no other purpose than to reduce the
      days to hours, the hours to minutes. The burden that fell upon him when he
      woke lay heavy on his heart till night, and oppressed him far into his
      sleep. He could not give his trouble certain shape; what was mostly with
      him was a formless loss, which he could not resolve into any definite
      shame or wrong. At times, what he had seen seemed to him some baleful
      trick of the imagination, some lurid and foolish illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could do nothing, he could not ask himself what the end was to be.
      He kept indoors by day, trying to work, trying to read, marveling somewhat
      that he did not fall sick and die. At night he set out on long walks,
      which took him he cared not where, and often detained him till the gray
      lights of morning began to tremble through the nocturnal blue. But even by
      night he shunned the neighborhood in which the Vervains had lived. Their
      landlord sent him a package of trifles they had left behind, but he
      refused to receive them, sending back word that he did not know where the
      ladies were. He had half expected that Mrs. Vervain, though he had not
      answered her last letter, might write to him again from England, but she
      did not. The Vervains had passed out of his world; he knew that they had
      been in it only by the torment they had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered in a listless way that he should see nothing of Don Ippolito.
      Once at midnight he fancied that the priest was coming towards him across
      a campo he had just entered; he stopped and turned back into the calle:
      when the priest came up to him, it was not Don Ippolito.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days Ferris received a dispatch from the Department of State,
      informing him that his successor had been appointed, and directing him to
      deliver up the consular flags, seals, archives, and other property of the
      United States. No reason for his removal was given; but as there had never
      been any reason for his appointment, he had no right to complain; the
      balance was exactly dressed by this simple device of our civil service. He
      determined not to wait for the coming of his successor before giving up
      the consular effects, and he placed them at once in the keeping of the
      worthy ship-chandler who had so often transferred them from departing to
      arriving consuls. Then being quite ready at any moment to leave Venice, he
      found himself in nowise eager to go; but he began in a desultory way to
      pack up his sketches and studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as he sat idle in his dismantled studio, Marina came to tell
      him that an old woman, waiting at the door below, wished to speak with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her come up,&rdquo; said Ferris wearily, and presently Marina
      returned with a very ill-favored beldam, who stared hard at him while he
      frowningly puzzled himself as to where he had seen that malign visage
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come,&rdquo; answered the old woman, &ldquo;on the part of Don Ippolito Rondinelli,
      who desires so much to see your excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris made no response, while the old woman knotted the fringe of her
      shawl with quaking hands, and presently added with a tenderness in her
      voice which oddly discorded with the hardness of her face: &ldquo;He has been
      very sick, poor thing, with a fever; but now he is in his senses again,
      and the doctors say he will get well. I hope so. But he is still very
      weak. He tried to write two lines to you, but he had not the strength; so
      he bade me bring you this word: That he had something to say which it
      greatly concerned you to hear, and that he prayed you to forgive his not
      coming to revere you, for it was impossible, and that you should have the
      goodness to do him this favor, to come to find him the quickest you
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman wiped her eyes with the corner of her shawl, and her chin
      wobbled pathetically while she shot a glance of baleful dislike at Ferris,
      who answered after a long dull stare at her, &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not believe that Don Ippolito could tell him anything that greatly
      concerned him; but he was worn out with going round in the same circle of
      conjecture, and so far as he could be glad, he was glad of this chance to
      face his calamity. He would go, but not at once; he would think it over;
      he would go to-morrow, when he had got some grasp of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; repeated Ferris impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand excuses; but my poor master has been very sick. The doctors
      say he will get well. I hope so. But he is very weak indeed; a little
      shock, a little disappointment.... Is the signore very, <i>very</i> much
      occupied this morning? He greatly desired,&mdash;he prayed that if such a
      thing were possible in the goodness of your excellency .... But I am
      offending the signore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old wretch set up a pitiful whimper, and tried to possess herself of
      his hand; she kissed his coat-sleeve instead. &ldquo;That you will return with
      me,&rdquo; she besought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; groaned the painter. &ldquo;I might as well go first as last,&rdquo; he
      added in English. &ldquo;There, stop that! Enough, enough, I tell you! Didn&rsquo;t I
      say I was going with you?&rdquo; he cried to the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; she mumbled, and set off before him down the stairs and
      out of the door. She looked so miserably old and weary that he called a
      gondola to his landing and made her get into it with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It tormented Don Ippolito&rsquo;s idle neighborhood to see Veneranda arrive in
      such state, and a passionate excitement arose at the caffè, where the
      person of the consul was known, when Ferris entered the priest&rsquo;s house
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not often visited Don Ippolito, but the quaintness of the place had
      been so vividly impressed upon him, that he had a certain familiarity with
      the grape-arbor of the anteroom, the paintings of the parlor, and the
      puerile arrangement of the piano and melodeon. Veneranda led him through
      these rooms to the chamber where Don Ippolito had first shown him his
      inventions. They were all removed now, and on a bed, set against the wall
      opposite the door, lay the priest, with his hands on his breast, and a
      faint smile on his lips, so peaceful, so serene, that the painter stopped
      with a sudden awe, as if he had unawares come into the presence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance, advance,&rdquo; whispered the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the head of the bed sat a white-haired priest wearing the red
      stockings of a canonico; his face was fanatically stern; but he rose, and
      bowed courteously to Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stir of his robes roused Don Ippolito. He slowly and weakly turned his
      head, and his eyes fell upon the painter. He made a helpless gesture of
      salutation with his thin hand, and began to excuse himself, for the
      trouble he had given, with a gentle politeness that touched the painter&rsquo;s
      heart through all the complex resentments that divided them. It was indeed
      a strange ground on which the two men met. Ferris could not have described
      Don Ippolito as his enemy, for the priest had wittingly done him no wrong;
      he could not have logically hated him as a rival, for till it was too late
      he had not confessed to his own heart the love that was in it; he knew no
      evil of Don Ippolito, he could not accuse him of any betrayal of trust, or
      violation of confidence. He felt merely that this hapless creature, lying
      so deathlike before him, had profaned, however involuntarily, what was
      sacredest in the world to him; beyond this all was chaos. He had heard of
      the priest&rsquo;s sickness with a fierce hardening of the heart; yet as he
      beheld him now, he began to remember things that moved him to a sort of
      remorse. He recalled again the simple loyalty with which Don Ippolito had
      first spoken to him of Miss Vervain and tried to learn his own feeling
      toward her; he thought how trustfully at their last meeting the priest had
      declared his love and hope, and how, when he had coldly received his
      confession, Don Ippolito had solemnly adjured him to be frank with him;
      and Ferris could not. That pity for himself as the prey of fantastically
      cruel chances, which he had already vaguely felt, began now also to
      include the priest; ignoring all but that compassion, he went up to the
      bed and took the weak, chill, nerveless hand in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canonico rose and placed his chair for Ferris beside the pillow, on
      which lay a brass crucifix, and then softly left the room, exchanging a
      glance of affectionate intelligence with the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have waited a little while,&rdquo; said Don Ippolito weakly, speaking
      in a hollow voice that was the shadow of his old deep tones, &ldquo;but you will
      know how to forgive the impatience of a man not yet quite master of
      himself. I thank you for coming. I have been very sick, as you see; I did
      not think to live; I did not care.... I am very weak, now; let me say to
      you quickly what I want to say. Dear friend,&rdquo; continued Don Ippolito,
      fixing his eyes upon the painter&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I spoke to her that night after
      I had parted from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest&rsquo;s voice was now firm; the painter turned his face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke without hope,&rdquo; proceeded Don Ippolito, &ldquo;and because I must. I
      spoke in vain; all was lost, all was past in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coil of suspicions and misgivings and fears in which Ferris had lived
      was suddenly without a clew; he could not look upon the pallid visage of
      the priest lest he should now at last find there that subtle expression of
      deceit; the whirl of his thoughts kept him silent; Don Ippolito went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I had never been a priest, I would still have been impossible to
      her. She&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as if for want of strength to go on. All at once he cried,
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; and he rapidly recounted the story of his life, ending with the
      fatal tragedy of his love. When it was told, he said calmly, &ldquo;But now
      everything is over with me on earth. I thank the Infinite Compassion for
      the sorrows through which I have passed. I, also, have proved the
      miraculous power of the church, potent to save in all ages.&rdquo; He gathered
      the crucifix in his spectral grasp, and pressed it to his lips. &ldquo;Many
      merciful things have befallen me on this bed of sickness. My uncle, whom
      the long years of my darkness divided from me, is once more at peace with
      me. Even that poor old woman whom I sent to call you, and who had served
      me as I believed with hate for me as a false priest in her heart, has
      devoted herself day and night to my helplessness; she has grown decrepit
      with her cares and vigils. Yes, I have had many and signal marks of the
      divine pity to be grateful for.&rdquo; He paused, breathing quickly, and then
      added, &ldquo;They tell me that the danger of this sickness is past. But none
      the less I have died in it. When I rise from this bed it shall be to take
      the vows of a Carmelite friar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris made no answer, and Don Ippolito resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you how when I first owned to her the falsehood in which I
      lived, she besought me to try if I might not find consolation in the holy
      life to which I had been devoted. When you see her, dear friend, will you
      not tell her that I came to understand that this comfort, this refuge,
      awaited me in the cell of the Carmelite? I have brought so much trouble
      into her life that I would fain have her know I have found peace where she
      bade me seek it, that I have mastered my affliction by reconciling myself
      to it. Tell her that but for her pity and fear for me, I believe that I
      must have died in my sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps inevitable from Ferris&rsquo;s Protestant association of monks
      and convents and penances chiefly with the machinery of fiction, that all
      this affected him as unreally as talk in a stage-play. His heart was cold,
      as he answered: &ldquo;I am glad that your mind is at rest concerning the doubts
      which so long troubled you. Not all men are so easily pacified; but, as
      you say, it is the privilege of your church to work miracles. As to Miss
      Vervain, I am sorry that I cannot promise to give her your message. I
      shall never see her again. Excuse me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but your servant
      said there was something you wished to say that concerned me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never see her again!&rdquo; cried the priest, struggling to lift
      himself upon his elbow and falling back upon the pillow. &ldquo;Oh, bereft! Oh,
      deaf and blind! It was <i>you</i> that she loved! She confessed it to me
      that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Ferris, trying to steady his voice, and failing; &ldquo;I was with
      Mrs. Vervain that night; she sent me into the garden to call her daughter,
      and I saw how Miss Vervain parted from the man she did not love! I
      saw&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a horrible thing to have said it, he felt now that he had spoken; a
      sense of the indelicacy, the shamefulness, seemed to alienate him from all
      high concern in the matter, and to leave him a mere self-convicted
      eavesdropper. His face flamed; the wavering hopes, the wavering doubts
      alike died in his heart. He had fallen below the dignity of his own
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw, you saw,&rdquo; softly repeated the priest, without looking at him,
      and without any show of emotion; apparently, the convalescence that had
      brought him perfect clearness of reason had left his sensibilities still
      somewhat dulled. He closed his lips and lay silent. At last, he asked very
      gently, &ldquo;And how shall I make you believe that what you saw was not a
      woman&rsquo;s love, but an angel&rsquo;s heavenly pity for me? Does it seem hard to
      believe this of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the painter doggedly, &ldquo;it is hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is the very truth. Oh, you do not know her, you never knew
      her! In the same moment that she denied me her love, she divined the
      anguish of my soul, and with that embrace she sought to console me for the
      friendlessness of a whole life, past and to come. But I know that I waste
      my words on you,&rdquo; he cried bitterly. &ldquo;You never would see me as I was; you
      would find no singleness in me, and yet I had a heart as full of loyalty
      to you as love for her. In what have I been false to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never were false to me,&rdquo; answered Ferris, &ldquo;and God knows I have been
      true to you, and at what cost. We might well curse the day we met, Don
      Ippolito, for we have only done each other harm. But I never meant you
      harm. And now I ask you to forgive me if I cannot believe you. I cannot&mdash;yet.
      I am of another race from you, slow to suspect, slow to trust. Give me a
      little time; let me see you again. I want to go away and think. I don&rsquo;t
      question your truth. I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m afraid that the same
      deceit has tricked us both. I must come to you to-morrow. Can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and stood beside the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely,&rdquo; answered the priest, looking into Ferris&rsquo;s troubled eyes
      with calm meekness. &ldquo;You will do me the greatest pleasure. Yes, come again
      to-morrow. You know,&rdquo; he said with a sad smile, referring to his purpose
      of taking vows, &ldquo;that my time in the world is short. Adieu, to meet
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Ferris&rsquo;s hand, hanging weak and hot by his side, and drew him
      gently down by it, and kissed him on either bearded cheek. &ldquo;It is our
      custom, you know, among <i>friends</i>. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canonico in the anteroom bowed austerely to him as he passed through;
      the old woman refused with a harsh &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; the money he offered her at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bitterly upbraided himself for the doubts he could not banish, and he
      still flushed with shame that he should have declared his knowledge of a
      scene which ought, at its worst, to have been inviolable by his speech. He
      scarcely cared now for the woman about whom these miseries grouped
      themselves; he realized that a fantastic remorse may be stronger than a
      jealous love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed for the morrow to come, that he might confess his shame and
      regret; but a reaction to this violent repentance came before the night
      fell. As the sound of the priest&rsquo;s voice and the sight of his wasted face
      faded from the painter&rsquo;s sense, he began to see everything in the old
      light again. Then what Don Ippolito had said took a character of
      ludicrous, of insolent improbability.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dark, Ferris set out upon one of his long, rambling walks. He walked
      hard and fast, to try if he might not still, by mere fatigue of body, the
      anguish that filled his soul. But whichever way he went he came again and
      again to the house of Don Ippolito, and at last he stopped there, leaning
      against the parapet of the quay, and staring at the house, as though he
      would spell from the senseless stones the truth of the secret they
      sheltered. Far up in the chamber, where he knew that the priest lay, the
      windows were dimly lit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood thus, with his upturned face haggard in the moonlight, the
      soldier commanding the Austrian patrol which passed that way halted his
      squad, and seemed about to ask him what he wanted there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris turned and walked swiftly homeward; but he did not even lie down.
      His misery took the shape of an intent that would not suffer him to rest.
      He meant to go to Don Ippolito and tell him that his story had failed of
      its effect, that he was not to be fooled so easily, and, without demanding
      anything further, to leave him in his lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the earliest hour when he might hope to be admitted, he went, and rang
      the bell furiously. The door opened, and he confronted the priest&rsquo;s
      servant. &ldquo;I want to see Don Ippolito,&rdquo; said Ferris abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I must,&rdquo; cried Ferris, raising his voice. &ldquo;I tell you.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madman!&rdquo; fiercely whispered the old woman, shaking both her open hands in
      his face, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dead! He died last night!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The terrible stroke sobered Ferris, he woke from his long debauch of hate
      and jealousy and despair; for the first time since that night in the
      garden, he faced his fate with a clear mind. Death had set his seal
      forever to a testimony which he had been able neither to refuse nor to
      accept; in abject sorrow and shame he thanked God that he had been kept
      from dealing that last cruel blow; but if Don Ippolito had come back from
      the dead to repeat his witness, Ferris felt that the miracle could not
      change his own passive state. There was now but one thing in the world for
      him to do: to see Florida, to confront her with his knowledge of all that
      had been, and to abide by her word, whatever it was. At the worst, there
      was the war, whose drums had already called to him, for a refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought at first that he might perhaps overtake the Vervains before
      they sailed for America, but he remembered that they had left Venice six
      weeks before. It seemed impossible that he could wait, but when he landed
      in New York, he was tormented in his impatience by a strange reluctance
      and hesitation. A fantastic light fell upon his plans; a sense of its
      wildness enfeebled his purpose. What was he going to do? Had he come four
      thousand miles to tell Florida that Don Ippolito was dead? Or was he going
      to say, &ldquo;I have heard that you love me, but I don&rsquo;t believe it: is it
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed on to Providence, stifling these antic misgivings as he might,
      and without allowing himself time to falter from his intent, he set out to
      find Mrs. Vervain&rsquo;s house. He knew the street and the number, for she had
      often given him the address in her invitations against the time when he
      should return to America. As he drew near the house a tender trepidation
      filled him and silenced all other senses in him; his heart beat thickly;
      the universe included only the fact that he was to look upon the face he
      loved, and this fact had neither past nor future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a terrible foreboding as of death seized him when he stood before the
      house, and glanced up at its close-shuttered front, and round upon the
      dusty grass-plots and neglected flower-beds of the door-yard. With a cold
      hand he rang and rang again, and no answer came. At last a man lounged up
      to the fence from the next house-door. &ldquo;Guess you won&rsquo;t make anybody
      hear,&rdquo; he said, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Mrs. Vervain live in this house?&rdquo; asked Ferris, finding a husky
      voice in his throat that sounded to him like some other&rsquo;s voice lost
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She used to, but she isn&rsquo;t at home. Family&rsquo;s in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had not come back yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Ferris mechanically, and he went away. He laughed to
      himself at this keen irony of fortune; he was prepared for the
      confirmation of his doubts; he was ready for relief from them, Heaven
      knew; but this blank that the turn of the wheel had brought, this Nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vervains were as lost to him as if Europe were in another planet. How
      should he find them there? Besides, he was poor; he had no money to get
      back with, if he had wanted to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the first train to New York, and hunted up a young fellow of his
      acquaintance, who in the days of peace had been one of the governor&rsquo;s
      aides. He was still holding this place, and was an ardent recruiter. He
      hailed with rapture the expression of Ferris&rsquo;s wish to go into the war.
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you have some rank
      as a consul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ferris with a dreary smile, &ldquo;I have been equivalent to a
      commander in the navy and a colonel in the army&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean both,
      but either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried his friend. &ldquo;We must strike high. The colonelcies are rather
      inaccessible, just at present, and so are the lieutenant-colonelcies, but
      a majorship, now&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; pleaded Ferris. &ldquo;Make me a corporal&mdash;or a cook. I
      shall not be so mischievous to our own side, then, and when the other
      fellows shoot me, I shall not be so much of a loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t <i>shoot</i> you,&rdquo; expostulated his friend,
      high-heartedly. He got Ferris a commission as second lieutenant, and lent
      him money to buy a uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris&rsquo;s regiment was sent to a part of the southwest, where he saw a good
      deal of fighting and fever and ague. At the end of two years, spent
      alternately in the field and the hospital, he was riding out near the camp
      one morning in unusual spirits, when two men in butternut fired at him:
      one had the mortification to miss him; the bullet of the other struck him
      in the arm. There was talk of amputation at first, but the case was
      finally managed without. In Ferris&rsquo;s state of health it was quite the same
      an end of his soldiering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came North sick and maimed and poor. He smiled now to think of
      confronting Florida in any imperative or challenging spirit; but the
      current of his hopeless melancholy turned more and more towards her. He
      had once, at a desperate venture, written to her at Providence, but he had
      got no answer. He asked of a Providence man among the artists in New York,
      if he knew the Vervains; the Providence man said that he did know them a
      little when he was much younger; they had been abroad a great deal; he
      believed in a dim way that they were still in Europe. The young one, he
      added, used to have a temper of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Ferris stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one fast friend whom he found in New York was the governor&rsquo;s dashing
      aide. The enthusiasm of this recruiter of regiments had not ceased with
      Ferris&rsquo;s departure for the front; the number of disabled officers forbade
      him to lionize any one of them, but he befriended Ferris; he made a feint
      of discovering the open secret of his poverty, and asked how he could help
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ferris, &ldquo;it looks like a hopeless case, to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted his friend, as cheerfully and confidently as he
      had promised him that he should not be shot. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you bring back any
      pictures from Venice with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought back a lot of sketches and studies. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I
      loafed a good deal there; I used to feel that I had eternity before me;
      and I was a theorist and a purist and an idiot generally. There are none
      of them fit to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; let&rsquo;s look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hunted out Ferris&rsquo;s property from a catch-all closet in the studio of
      a sculptor with whom he had left them, and who expressed a polite pleasure
      in handing them over to Ferris rather than to his heirs and assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure that I share your satisfaction, old fellow,&rdquo; said the
      painter ruefully; but he unpacked the sketches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their inspection certainly revealed a disheartening condition of
      half-work. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t do anything to help the matter for the present,&rdquo;
       groaned Ferris, stopping midway in the business, and making as if to shut
      the case again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Why, this isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo; It was
      the study of Don Ippolito as a Venetian priest, which Ferris beheld with a
      stupid amaze, remembering that he had meant to destroy it, and wondering
      how it had got where it was, but not really caring much. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than
      you can imagine,&rdquo; said he, still looking at it with this apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; I want you to sell it to me. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied Ferris piteously. &ldquo;It would be flat burglary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then put it into the exhibition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor, who had gone back to scraping the chin of the famous public
      man on whose bust he was at work, stabbed him to the heart with his
      modeling-tool, and turned to Ferris and his friend. He slanted his broad
      red beard for a sidelong look at the picture, and said: &ldquo;I know what you
      mean, Ferris. It&rsquo;s hard, and it&rsquo;s feeble in some ways and it looks a
      little too much like experimenting. But it isn&rsquo;t so <i>infernally</i>
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fulsome,&rdquo; responded Ferris, jadedly. He was thinking in a
      thoroughly vanquished mood what a tragico-comic end of the whole business
      it was that poor Don Ippolito should come to his rescue in this fashion,
      and as it were offer to succor him in his extremity. He perceived the
      shamefulness of suffering such help; it would be much better to starve;
      but he felt cowed, and he had not courage to take arms against this
      sarcastic destiny, which had pursued him with a mocking smile from one
      lower level to another. He rubbed his forehead and brooded upon the
      picture. At least it would be some comfort to be rid of it; and Don
      Ippolito was dead; and to whom could it mean more than the face of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend had his way about framing it, and it was got into the
      exhibition. The hanging-committee offered it the hospitalities of an
      obscure corner; but it was there, and it stood its chance. Nobody seemed
      to know that it was there, however, unless confronted with it by Ferris&rsquo;s
      friend, and then no one seemed to care for it, much less want to buy it.
      Ferris saw so many much worse pictures sold all around it, that he began
      gloomily to respect it. At first it had shocked him to see it on the
      Academy&rsquo;s wall; but it soon came to have no other relation to him than
      that of creatureship, like a poem in which a poet celebrates his love or
      laments his dead, and sells for a price. His pride as well as his poverty
      was set on having the picture sold; he had nothing to do, and he used to
      lurk about, and see if it would not interest somebody at last. But it
      remained unsold throughout May, and well into June, long after the crowds
      had ceased to frequent the exhibition, and only chance visitors from the
      country straggled in by twos and threes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One warm, dusty afternoon, when he turned into the Academy out of Fourth
      Avenue, the empty hall echoed to no footfall but his own. A group of weary
      women, who wore that look of wanting lunch which characterizes all
      picture-gallery-goers at home and abroad, stood faint before a certain
      large Venetian subject which Ferris abhorred, and the very name of which
      he spat out of his mouth with loathing for its unreality. He passed them
      with a sombre glance, as he took his way toward the retired spot where his
      own painting hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady whose crapes would have betrayed to her own sex the latest touch of
      Paris stood a little way back from it, and gazed fixedly at it. The pose
      of her head, her whole attitude, expressed a quiet dejection; without
      seeing her face one could know its air of pensive wistfulness. Ferris
      resolved to indulge himself in a near approach to this unwonted spectacle
      of interest in his picture; at the sound of his steps the lady slowly
      turned a face of somewhat heavily molded beauty, and from low-growing,
      thick pale hair and level brows, stared at him with the sad eyes of
      Florida Vervain. She looked fully the last two years older.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though she were listening to the sound of his steps in the dark instead
      of having him there visibly before her, she kept her eyes upon him with a
      dreamy unrecognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is I,&rdquo; said Ferris, as if she had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself, and with a subdued, sorrowful quiet in her old
      directness, she answered, &ldquo;I supposed you must be in New York,&rdquo; and she
      indicated that she had supposed so from seeing this picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris felt the blood mounting to his head. &ldquo;Do you think it is like?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t just to him; it attributes things that didn&rsquo;t
      belong to him, and it leaves out a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could scarcely have hoped to please you in a portrait of Don Ippolito.&rdquo;
       Ferris saw the red light break out as it used on the girl&rsquo;s pale cheeks,
      and her eyes dilate angrily. He went on recklessly: &ldquo;He sent for me after
      you went away, and gave me a message for you. I never promised to deliver
      it, but I will do so now. He asked me to tell you when we met, that he had
      acted on your desire, and had tried to reconcile himself to his calling
      and his religion; he was going to enter a Carmelite convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida made no answer, but she seemed to expect him to go on, and he was
      constrained to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never carried out his purpose,&rdquo; Ferris said, with a keen glance at
      her; &ldquo;he died the night after I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died?&rdquo; The fan and the parasol and the two or three light packages she
      had been holding slid down one by one, and lay at her feet. &ldquo;Thank you for
      bringing me his last words,&rdquo; she said, but did not ask him anything more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris did not offer to gather up her things; he stood irresolute;
      presently he continued with a downcast look: &ldquo;He had had a fever, but they
      thought he was getting well. His death must have been sudden.&rdquo; He stopped,
      and resumed fiercely, resolved to have the worst out: &ldquo;I went to him, with
      no good-will toward him, the next day after I saw him; but I came too
      late. That was God&rsquo;s mercy to me. I hope you have your consolation, Miss
      Vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It maddened him to see her so little moved, and he meant to make her share
      his remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he blame me for anything?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Ferris, with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;he praised you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; returned Florida, &ldquo;for I have thought it all over
      many times, and I know that I was not to blame, though at first I blamed
      myself. I never intended him anything but good. That is <i>my</i>
      consolation, Mr. Ferris. But you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you seem to make yourself
      my judge. Well, and what do <i>you</i> blame me for? I have a right to
      know what is in your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing that was in his mind had rankled there for two years; in many a
      black reverie of those that alternated with his moods of abject
      self-reproach and perfect trust of her, he had confronted her and flung it
      out upon her in one stinging phrase. But he was now suddenly at a loss;
      the words would not come; his torment fell dumb before her; in her
      presence the cause was unspeakable. Her lips had quivered a little in
      making that demand, and there had been a corresponding break in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florida! Florida!&rdquo; Ferris heard himself saying, &ldquo;I loved you all the
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh indeed, did you love me?&rdquo; she cried, indignantly, while the tears
      shone in her eyes. &ldquo;And was that why you left a helpless young girl to
      meet that trouble alone? Was that why you refused me your advice, and
      turned your back on me, and snubbed me? Oh, many thanks for your love!&rdquo;
       She dashed the gathered tears angrily away, and went on. &ldquo;Perhaps you
      knew, too, what that poor priest was thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ferris, stolidly, &ldquo;I did at last: he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you acted generously and nobly to let him go on! It was kind to
      him, and very, very kind to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo; demanded Ferris, amazed and furious to find himself on
      the defensive. &ldquo;His telling me put it out of my power to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that you can satisfy yourself with such a quibble! But I wonder
      that you can tell <i>me</i>&mdash;<i>any</i> woman of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heavens, this is atrocious!&rdquo; cried Ferris. &ldquo;Do you think ... Look
      here!&rdquo; he went on rudely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the case to you, and you shall judge
      it. Remember that I was such a fool as to be in love with you. Suppose Don
      Ippolito had told me that he was going to risk everything&mdash;going to
      give up home, religion, friends&mdash;on the ten thousandth part of a
      chance that you might some day care for him. I did not believe he had even
      so much chance as that; but he had always thought me his friend, and he
      trusted me. Was it a quibble that kept me from betraying him? I don&rsquo;t know
      what honor is among women; but no <i>man</i> could have done it. I confess
      to my shame that I went to your house that night longing to betray him.
      And then suppose your mother sent me into the garden to call you, and I
      saw ... what has made my life a hell of doubt for the last two years; what
      ... No, excuse me! I can&rsquo;t put the case to you after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Florida. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I mean? You don&rsquo;t understand? Are you so blind as that, or are
      you making a fool of me? What could I think but that you had played with
      that priest&rsquo;s heart till your own&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Florida with a shudder, starting away from him, &ldquo;did you think
      I was such a wicked girl as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no defense, no explanation, no denial; it simply left the case with
      Ferris as before. He stood looking like a man who does not know whether to
      bless or curse himself, to laugh or blaspheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stooped and tried to pick up the things she had let fall upon the
      floor; but she seemed not able to find them. He bent over, and, gathering
      them together, returned them to her with his left hand, keeping the other
      in the breast of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said; and then after a moment, &ldquo;Have you been hurt?&rdquo; she
      asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ferris in a sulky way. &ldquo;I have had my share.&rdquo; He glanced down
      at his arm askance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather conventional,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much
      of a hurt; but then, I wasn&rsquo;t much of a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eyes looked reverently at the conventional arm; those were the
      days, so long past, when women worshipped men for such things. But she
      said nothing, and as Ferris&rsquo;s eyes wandered to her, he received a novel
      and painful impression. He said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I have not asked before:
      but your mother, Miss Vervain&mdash;I hope she is well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead,&rdquo; answered Florida, with stony quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent for a time. Then Ferris said, &ldquo;I had a great
      affection for your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;she was fond of you, too. But you never wrote or
      sent her any word; it used to grieve her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her unjust reproach went to his heart, so long preoccupied with its own
      troubles; he recalled with a tender remorse the old Venetian days and the
      kindliness of the gracious, silly woman who had seemed to like him so
      much; he remembered the charm of her perfect ladylikeness, and of her
      winning, weak-headed desire to make every one happy to whom she spoke; the
      beauty of the good-will, the hospitable soul that in an imaginably better
      world than this will outvalue a merely intellectual or aesthetic life. He
      humbled himself before her memory, and as keenly reproached himself as if
      he could have made her hear from him at any time during the past two
      years. He could only say, &ldquo;I am sorry that I gave your mother pain; I
      loved her very truly. I hope that she did not suffer much before&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Florida, &ldquo;it was a peaceful end; but finally it was very
      sudden. She had not been well for many years, with that sort of decline; I
      used sometimes to feel troubled about her before we came to Venice; but I
      was very young. I never was really alarmed till that day I went to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Ferris contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had fainted, and I thought we ought to see a doctor; but afterwards,
      because I thought that I ought not to do so without speaking to her, I did
      not go to the doctor; and that day we made up our minds to get home as
      soon as we could; and she seemed so much better, for a while; and then,
      everything seemed to happen at once. When we did start home, she could not
      go any farther than Switzerland, and in the fall we went back to Italy. We
      went to Sorrento, where the climate seemed to do her good. But she was
      growing frailer, the whole time. She died in March. I found some old
      friends of hers in Naples, and came home with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated a little over the words, which she nevertheless uttered
      unbroken, while the tears fell quietly down her face. She seemed to have
      forgotten the angry words that had passed between her and Ferris, to
      remember him only as one who had known her mother, while she went on to
      relate some little facts in the history of her mother&rsquo;s last days; and she
      rose into a higher, serener atmosphere, inaccessible to his resentment or
      his regret, as she spoke of her loss. The simple tale of sickness and
      death inexpressibly belittled his passionate woes, and made them look
      theatrical to him. He hung his head as they turned at her motion and
      walked away from the picture of Don Ippolito, and down the stairs toward
      the street-door; the people before the other Venetian picture had
      apparently yielded to their craving for lunch, and had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have very little to tell you of my own life,&rdquo; Ferris began awkwardly.
      &ldquo;I came home soon after you started, and I went to Providence to find you,
      but you had not got back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida stopped him and looked perplexedly into his face, and then moved
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I went into the army. I wrote once to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never got your letter,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now in the lower hall, and near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florida,&rdquo; said Ferris, abruptly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor and disabled; I&rsquo;ve no more
      right than any sick beggar in the street to say it to you; but I loved
      you, I must always love you. I&mdash;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She halted him again, and &ldquo;You said,&rdquo; she grieved, &ldquo;that you doubted me;
      you said that I had made your life a&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I said that; I know it,&rdquo; answered Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I could be such a false and cruel girl as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes: I thought it all, God help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was only sorry for him, when it was you that I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it,&rdquo; answered Ferris in a heartsick, hopeless voice. &ldquo;He knew
      it, too. He told me so the day before he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you believe him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe anything you tell me. When I look at you, I can&rsquo;t believe I
      ever doubted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s no reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; but I&rsquo;m used to being without a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Florida looked gravely at his penitent face, and a brave red color mantled
      her own, while she advanced an unanswerable argument: &ldquo;Then what are you
      going away for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world seemed to melt and float away from between them. It returned and
      solidified at the sound of the janitor&rsquo;s steps as he came towards them on
      his round through the empty building. Ferris caught her hand; she leaned
      heavily upon his arm as they walked out into the street. It was all they
      could do at the moment except to look into each other&rsquo;s faces, and walk
      swiftly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after how long a time he did not know, Ferris cried: &ldquo;Where are
      we going, Florida?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stopping with those friends of ours
      at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. We <i>were</i> going on to Providence
      to-morrow. We landed yesterday; and we stayed to do some shopping&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask why you happened to give your first moments in America to
      the fine arts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fine arts? Oh! I thought I might find something of yours, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel she presented him to her party as a friend whom her mother
      and she had known in Italy; and then went to lay aside her hat. The
      Providence people received him with the easy, half-southern warmth of
      manner which seems to have floated northward as far as their city on the
      Gulf Stream bathing the Rhode Island shores. The matron of the party had,
      before Florida came back, an outline history of their acquaintance, which
      she evolved from him with so much tact that he was not conscious of
      parting with information; and she divined indefinitely more when she saw
      them together again. She was charming; but to Ferris&rsquo;s thinking she had a
      fault, she kept him too much from Florida, though she talked of nothing
      else, and at the last she was discreetly merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; whispered Florida, very close against his face, when they
      parted, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll have a bad temper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will&mdash;or I shall be killed with kindness,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a moment, nervously buttoning his coat across his breast. &ldquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t let that picture be sold, Henry,&rdquo; she said, and by this touch
      alone did she express any sense, if she had it, of his want of feeling in
      proposing to sell it. He winced, and she added with a soft pity in her
      voice, &ldquo;He did bring us together, after all. I wish you had believed him,
      dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Ferris, most humbly.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      People are never equal to the romance of their youth in after life, except
      by fits, and Ferris especially could not keep himself at what he called
      the operatic pitch of their brief betrothal and the early days of their
      marriage. With his help, or even his encouragement, his wife might have
      been able to maintain it. She had a gift for idealizing him, at least, and
      as his hurt healed but slowly, and it was a good while before he could
      paint with his wounded arm, it was an easy matter for her to believe in
      the meanwhile that he would have been the greatest painter of his time,
      but for his honorable disability; to hear her, you would suppose no one
      else had ever been shot in the service of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Ferris, since he could not work, that she had money;
      in exalted moments he had thought this a barrier to their marriage; yet he
      could not recall any one who had refused the hand of a beautiful girl
      because of the accident of her wealth, and in the end he silenced his
      scruples. It might be said that in many other ways he was not her equal;
      but one ought to reflect how very few men are worthy of their wives in any
      sense. After his fashion he certainly loved her always,&mdash;even when
      she tried him most, for it must be owned that she really had that hot
      temper which he had dreaded in her from the first. Not that her
      imperiousness directly affected him. For a long time after their marriage,
      she seemed to have no other desire than to lose her outwearied will in
      his. There was something a little pathetic in this; there was a kind of
      bewilderment in her gentleness, as though the relaxed tension of her long
      self-devotion to her mother left her without a full motive; she apparently
      found it impossible to give herself with a satisfactory degree of abandon
      to a man who could do so many things for himself. When her children came
      they filled this vacancy, and afforded her scope for the greatest excesses
      of self-devotion. Ferris laughed to find her protecting them and serving
      them with the same tigerish tenderness, the same haughty humility, as that
      with which she used to care for poor Mrs. Vervain; and he perceived that
      this was merely the direction away from herself of that intense arrogance
      of nature which, but for her power and need of loving, would have made her
      intolerable. What she chiefly exacted from them in return for her fierce
      devotedness was the truth in everything; she was content that they should
      be rather less fond of her than of their father, whom indeed they found
      much more amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ferrises went to Europe some years after their marriage, revisiting
      Venice, but sojourning for the most part in Florence. Ferris had once
      imagined that the tragedy which had given him his wife would always invest
      her with the shadow of its sadness, but in this he was mistaken. There is
      nothing has really so strong a digestion as love, and this is very lucky,
      seeing what manifold experiences love has to swallow and assimilate; and
      when they got back to Venice, Ferris found that the customs of their joint
      life exorcised all the dark associations of the place. These simply formed
      a sombre background, against which their wedded happiness relieved itself.
      They talked much of the past, with free minds, unashamed and unafraid. If
      it is a little shocking, it is nevertheless true, and true to human
      nature, that they spoke of Don Ippolito as if he were a part of their
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferris had never ceased to wonder at what he called the unfathomable
      innocence of his wife, and he liked to go over all the points of their
      former life in Venice, and bring home to himself the utter simplicity of
      her girlish ideas, motives, and designs, which both confounded and
      delighted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing, Florida,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly amazing that you
      should have been willing to undertake the job of importing into America
      that poor fellow with his whole stock of helplessness, dreamery, and
      unpracticality. What <i>were</i> you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve often told you, Henry. I thought he oughtn&rsquo;t to continue a
      priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know.&rdquo; Then he would remain lost in thought, softly whistling
      to himself. On one of these occasions he asked, &ldquo;Do you think he was
      really very much troubled by his false position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, now. He seemed to be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That story he told you of his childhood and of how he became a priest;
      didn&rsquo;t it strike you at the time like rather a made-up, melodramatic
      history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! How can you say such things, Henry? It was too simple not to be
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well. Perhaps so. But he baffles me. He always did, for that
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came another pause, while Ferris lay back upon the gondola cushions,
      getting the level of the Lido just under his hat-brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he was very much of a skeptic, after all, Florida?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris turned her eyes reproachfully upon her husband. &ldquo;Why, Henry,
      how strange you are! You said yourself, once, that you used to wonder if
      he were not a skeptic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know. But for a man who had lived in doubt so many years, he
      certainly slipped back into the bosom of mother church pretty suddenly.
      Don&rsquo;t you think he was a person of rather light feelings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk with you, my dear, if you go on in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean any harm. I can see how in many things he was the soul of
      truth and honor. But it seems to me that even the life he lived was
      largely imagined. I mean that he was such a dreamer that once having
      fancied himself afflicted at being what he was, he could go on and suffer
      as keenly as if he really were troubled by it. Why mightn&rsquo;t it be that all
      his doubts came from anger and resentment towards those who made him a
      priest, rather than from any examination of his own mind? I don&rsquo;t say it
      <i>was</i> so. But I don&rsquo;t believe he knew quite what he wanted. He must
      have felt that his failure as an inventor went deeper than the failure of
      his particular attempts. I once thought that perhaps he had a genius in
      that way, but I question now whether he had. If he had, it seems to me he
      had opportunity to prove it&mdash;certainly, as a priest he had leisure to
      prove it. But when that sort of subconsciousness of his own inadequacy
      came over him, it was perfectly natural for him to take refuge in the
      supposition that he had been baffled by circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris remained silently troubled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to answer you,
      Henry; but I think that you&rsquo;re judging him narrowly and harshly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not harshly. I feel very compassionate towards him. But now, even as to
      what one might consider the most real thing in his life,&mdash;his caring
      for you,&mdash;it seems to me there must have been a great share of
      imagined sentiment in it. It was not a passion; it was a gentle nature&rsquo;s
      dream of a passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t die of a dream,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he died of a fever.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;He had got well of the fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true, my dear. And whatever his head was, he had an
      affectionate and faithful heart. I wish I had been gentler with him. I
      must often have bruised that sensitive soul. God knows I&rsquo;m sorry for it.
      But he&rsquo;s a puzzle, he&rsquo;s a puzzle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus lapsing more and more into a mere problem as the years have passed,
      Don Ippolito has at last ceased to be even the memory of a man with a
      passionate love and a mortal sorrow. Perhaps this final effect in the mind
      of him who has realized the happiness of which the poor priest vainly
      dreamed is not the least tragic phase of the tragedy of Don Ippolito.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
